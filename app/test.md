                                TO  THE

 TEACHERS  OF THE  NORMAL  SCHOOL


          OF  THE  STATE  OF  NEW-YORK.



GENTLEMEN    !
  A  stirring  freshness  in the  air, and  ruddy  streaks  upon  the
horizon  of the moral  world  betoken  the grateful dawning  of  a new
ora.  The  days  of a drivelling  instruction  are departing.  With
us  is the opening  promise  of a better  time, wherein  genuine  man
hood  doing  its noblest  work  shall have  adequate  reward.
TEACHER   is the highest  and  most  responsible  office man  can   fill.

Its dignity  is, and  will yet be held commensurate  with  its duty —

a duty boundless  as man's  intellectual  capacity,  and  great  as  his
moral  need —  a duty  from  the performance  of which  shall emanate
an  influence  not  limited  to the now  and  the  here, but which  surely
will, as time  flows  into eternity  and  space  into  infinity,  roll up,  a
measureless  curse  or  a  measureless  blessing,  in  inconceivable
swellings  along  the  infinite curve.   It is an  office that  should  be
esteemed  of even  sacred  import  in this country.  Ere  long  a hun
dred  millions, extending  from  the  Atlantic  to  the  Pacific, from

Baffin's Bay  to that  of Panama,  shall  call themselves  American
citizens.  What  a field  for those  two  master-passions  of the  hu
man  soul —  the  love  of Rule,  and  the  love  of Gain !  How   shall
our  liberties  continue  to be preserved  from  the graspings  of Am
bition and  the  corruptions  of Gold ?  Not  by  Bills  of Rights

    INTRODUCTION  TO THE  AMERICAN  EDITION.



   THAT  the PRINCIPIA  of Newton  should  have  remained  so  gen
erally unknown   in this country  to the present  day  is a somewhat
remarkable  fact ; because  the name  of the  author,  learned  with
the  very  elements  of  science,  is revered  at  every  hearth-stone
where  knowledge  and  virtue  are  of chief  esteem,  while,  abroad,
in all the  high places  of  the  land, the character  which  that name
recalls  is held  up  as the  noblest  illustration  of what  MAN  may  be,
and may  do, in the possession  and  manifestation  of pre-eminent
intellectual  and  moral  worth  ; because  the work   is celebrated,  not
only  in the  history  of one  career  and  one  mind,  but  in the  history
of all achievement  and human  reason  itself; because  of  the  spirit
of inquiry, which  has  been  aroused,  and  which,  in pursuing   its
searchings,  is not always  satisfied  with  stopping  short  of the foun
tain-head  of any  given  truth  ; and,  finally, because  of  the  earnest
endeavour  that  has  been  and  is constantly  going  on, in many
sections  of the Republic,  to elevate  the popular  standard  of edu
cation  and  give  to  scientific and  other  efforts  a  higher  and  a
better  aim.

   True,  the PRINCIPIA  has been  hitherto  inaccessible  to  popular
use.  A  few  copies  in Latin,  and  occasionally  one  in English may
be found  in some  of our  larger  libraries, or  in the  possession  of
some  ardent  disciple  of  the great Master.  But  a d^ad  language
in the one  case, and  an  enormous  price  in both,  particularly  in
that  of the English  edition, have  thus  far opposed  very  sufficient
obstacles  to the wide  circulation  of  the work.  It  is now, how
ever,  placed  within  the reach  of all.  And  in performing  this  la
bour,  the utmost  care  has  been  taken, by  collation,  revision,  and
otherwise,  to render  the  First American  Edition  the most  accurate

and  beautiful  in our  language.  u Le  plus beau  monument  que
l? on  puisse  clever  a la gloire  de Newton,  c'est une  bonne  edition

| and may do, | in the pos | session and | manifestat | ion of | pre-eminent |
| intellectual a | nd moral | worth ; b eca | use the wor | k is cel | ebrated, not |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| only in the hi | story of o | ne career a | nd one mind, | but in | the history |
| of all achieve | ment and | human reas | on itself; b | ecause | of the spirit |
| of inquiry, w | hich has | been arouse | d, and whi | ch, in | pursuing its |
| searchings, is | not alway | s satisfied | with stoppin | g short | of the foun |

set up.  The  PRINCIPIA,  above   all, glows  with  the immortality  of
a transcendant  mind.  Marble  and  brass  dissolve  and  pass away  ;
but  the  true  creations  of genius  endure,  in time  and  beyond  time,
forever  : high upon  the adamant  of the  indestructible,  they  send
forth  afar and  near,  over  the troublous  waters  of  life, a pure,  un
wavering,  quenchless  light whereby  the myriad  myriads  of barques,
richly laden  with  reason,  intelligence  and  various  faculty,  are
guided  through  the  night and  the  storm, by the  beetling  shore
and  the hidden  rock,  the breaker  and  the  shoal, safely  into havens
calm  and  secure.

   To  the teacher  and  the taught,  the  scholar  and  the  student,  the
devotee  of Science  and  the  worshipper  of Truth,  the PRINCIPIA
must  ever  continue  to be  of  inestimable  value.   If to educate
means,  not  so much  to store  the memory  with  symbols  and  facts,
as to bring  forth  the  faculties  of the  soul and  develope  them  to the
full by healthy  nurture  and  a hardy  discipline,  then, what  so  effec
tive  to the accomplishment  of that end  as  the study  of Geometri
cal Synthesis ?  The  Calculus,  in some  shape  or  other,  is, indeed,
necessary  to the  successful  prosecution  of researches  in the higher
branches  of philosophy.  But  has  not  the Analytical  encroached
upon  the Synthetical,  and Algorithmic  Formulae  been  employed
when  not  requisite,  either  for the evolution  of  truth,  or  even   its
apter  illustration ?  To  each  method  belongs,  undoubtedly,  an
appropriate  use.  Newton,  himself  the  inventor  of  Fluxions,
censured  the  handling  of Geometrical  subjects  by Algebraical
calculations  ; and  the maturest  opinions  which  he expressed  were
additionally  in favour  of  the Geometrical  Method.  His  prefer
ence,  so strongly  marked,  is not  to be reckoned   a mere  matter  oi
taste  ; and  his authority  should  bear  with  preponderating  weight
upon  the  decision  of every  instructor  in adopting  what  may  be
deemed  the  best  plan  to insure  the  completes!  mental  develop
ment.  Geometry,  the vigorous  product  of remote  time  ; blended
with  the  earliest  aspirations  of Science  and  the  earliest  applica
tions  of Art  ; as well  in the  measures  of music  as  in the move

view,  the outward  form  of that  Inner Harmony  of which  and  in
which  all things  are.  Plainly,  therefore,  this noble  study  has
other  and  infinitely higher  uses  than  to increase  the power  of ab
straction.  A  more  general  and  thorough  cultivation  of  it should
oe  strenuously  insisted on.  Passing  from  the pages  of Euclid  or
Legendre,  might  not  the  student  be  led, at the  suitable  time,  to
those  of the PRINCIPIA  wherein  Geometry  may  be found  in varied
use from  the  familiar  to the  sublime ?  The  profoundest  and  the
happiest  results,  it is believed, would  attend  upon  this enlargement
of our Educational  System.
   Let  the PRINCIPIA,  then, be gladly welcomed  into  every  Hall
where  a TRUE  TEACHER  presides.  And  they who  are  guided  to
the  diligent  study  of  this incomparable  work, who  become
strengthened  by  its reason,  assured  by  its evidence,  and  enlight
ened  by  its truths,  and who  rise into  loving communion  with  the
great  and  pure  spirit of  its author,  will go  forth from  the  scenes
of their  pupilage,  and  take  their  places  in the world  as strong-

             LIFE  OF

  SIE  ISAAC  NEWTON.





                  Nec  fas est proprius  mortal?  attingere  Divos. — HALLEY.



  FROM  the  thick  darkness  of  the middle  ages  man's  struggling
spirit emerged  as in new  birth ; breaking  out  of the  iron  control
of that period  ; growing  strong  and  confident  in the tug and  din
of succeeding  conflict  and  revolution,  it bounded  forwards  and
upwards  with  resistless  vigour  to the investigation  of physical  and
moral  truth  ; ascending  height  after  height  ; sweeping  afar  over
the  earth, penetrating  afar up  into  the heavens  ; increasing  in en
deavour,  enlarging  in endowment  ; every  where  boldly,  earnestly
out-stretching,  till, in the AUTHOR   of the  PRINCIPIA,  one  arose,
who,  grasping  the  master-key  of the  universe  and  treading  its
celestial  paths, opened  up  to the human  intellect  the  stupendous
realities  of the material  world,  and,  in the  unrolling  of  its harmo
nies, gave  to the human  heart  a new  song  to the goodness,  wis
dom,  and  majesty  of the  all-creating,  all-sustaining,  all-perfect
God.
   Sir Isaac Newton,  in whom   the  rising intellect seemed  to attain,
as  it were,  to  its culminating  point, was  born  on  the 25th  of De
cember,  O.  S. 1642 — Christmas  day — at Woolsthorpe,  in  the
parish  of Colsterworth,  in Lincolnshire.  His  father, John New
ton, died  at the  age  of thirty-six,  and  only  a few  months  after  his
marriage  to Harriet  Ayscough,  daughter  of James  Ayscough,  oi
Rutlandshire.  Mrs.  Newton,  probably  wrought  upon  by  the
early  loss of  her husband,  gave  premature  birth  to her  only and
posthumous  child,  of which,  too, from  its extreme  diminutiveness,
she appeared  likely  to be  soon  bereft.  Happily,  it was  otherwise
decreed !  The  tiny  infant,  on whose   little lips the breath  of  life

so doubtingly  hovered,  lived  ;—  lived  to  a vigorous  maturity,  to  a
hale  old  age  ;—  lived  to become  the boast  of his country,  the won
der  of his time,  and  the "ornament   of his  srjecies."
  Beyond  the  grandfather,  Robert  Newton,  the  descent  of  Sir
Isaac  cannot  with  certainty  be traced.  Two  traditions  were  held
in the  family  : one, that  they were  of Scotch  extraction  ; the
other,  that  they came  originally from  Newton,  in Lancashire,
dwelling,  for  a time, however,  at Westby,  county  of Lincoln,  be
fore  the removal  to and purchase  of Woolsthorpe —  about  a hundred
years  before  this memorable   birth.
  The  widow  Newton  was  left with  the  simple means  of a com
fortable  subsistence.    The  Woolsthorpe  estate  together  with
small  one  which  she possessed  at Sewstern,  in Leicestershire,  yield
ed her  an income  of some  eighty pounds  ; and  upon  this limited  sum,
she had  to rely chiefly  for the support  of herself, and  the educa
tion  of her  child.    She  continued  his  nurture  for three  years,
when,  marrying  again, she  confided  the tender  charge  to the  care
of her own  mother.
  Great  genius  is seldom  marked  by precocious  development  ;
and young  Isaac,  sent, at the  usual  age, to two  day  schools  at
Skillington  and  Stoke,  exhibited  no  unusual  traits  of  character.
In  his twelfth  year, he  was  placed  at the public  school  at Gran-
tham,  and  boarded  at  the  house  of Mr.  Clark,  an  apothecary.
But  even  in this excellent  seminary,  his mental  acquisitions  con
tinued  for  a while unpromising  enough  : study  apparentlv  had  no
charms  for him ; he  was  very  inattentive,  and  ranked  low  in  the
school.  One  day, however,  the boy immediately  above  our  seem
ingly  dull student  gave  him  a severe  kick  in the stomach  ; Isaac,
deeply  affected,  but  with  no  outburst  of  passion, betook  himself,
with  quiet, incessant  toil, to his books  ; he quickly  passed  above
the offending  classmate  ; yet  there  he  stopped  not ; the  strong
spirit was,  for  once  and  forever, awakened,  and, yielding  to  itb
noble  impulse,  he  speedily  took  up  his position  at the head  of  all.
   His  peculiar  character  began  now  rapidly  to  unfold   itself.
Close  application grew  to be  habitual.  Observation  alternated

with  reflection.  " A  sober,  silent, thinking  lad,"  yet, the  wisest
and  the  kindliest,  the indisputable  leader  of  his fellows.  Gener-

osity, modesty,  and  a love  of truth  distinguished  him  then  as ever
afterwards.  He  did  not  often  join  his classmates  in play ; but he
would  contrive  for them  various  amusements  of  a scientific  kind.
Paper  kites  he introduced  ; carefully  determining  their  best  form
and  proportions,  and  the  position  and number  of  points whereby
to attach  the  string. He  also  invented  paper  lanterns  ; these
served  ordinarily  to guide  the way  to  school  in winter  mornings,
but  occasionally  for quite another  purpose  ; they were  attached  to
the  tails of kites  in a dark  night,  to the dismay  of the country  people
dreading  portentous  comets,  and  to the immeasureable  delight  ol
his companions.  To  him, however,  young  as he  was,  life seemed
to have  become  an  earnest  thing.  When  not  occupied  with  his
studies,  his mind  would  be engrossed  with  mechanical  contrivances  ;
now  imitating, now  inventing.  He  became  singularly  skilful  in the
use  of  his  little saws,  hatchets,  hammers,  and  other  tools.  A
windmill  was  erected  near  Grantham  ; during  the  operations  ol
the workmen,  he was  frequently  present  ; in a short  time, he had
completed   a perfect working  model  of  it, which  elicited  general
admiration.  Not  content,  however,  with  this  exact  imitation,  he
conceived  the  idea  of employing,  in the place  of  sails, animal  power     ,
and, adapting  the construction  of his mill accordingly,  he enclosed
in it a mouse,  called  the  miller, and  which  by acting  on  a sort  ot
treadvvheel,  gave  motion  to  the machine.  He  invented,  too,  a
mechanical  carriage — having  four  wheels,  and  put  in motion  with
a handle  worked  by the person  sitting inside.  The  measurement

of time  early drew  his attention.  He   h'rst constructed  a  water
clock,  in proportions  somewhat   like  an old-fashioned  house  clock.
The  index  of the  dial plate was  turned  by  a piece  of wood  acted
upon by dropping  water.  This  instrument,  though  long used by

himself,  and by Mr.  Clark's  family, did  not  satisfy his  inquiring
mind.  His  thoughts  rose  to the  sun  ; and, by  careful  and  oft-re
peated  observations  of the  solar movements,  he  subsequently

formed  many  dials.  One  of  these, named  Isaac's  dial, was  the
accurate  result  of  years'  labour, and  was  frequently  referred  to
for the hour  of the day by  the country  people.
  May  we  not  discern  in these  continual  efforts — the  diligent  re
search^  the  patient  meditation,  the  aspiring  glance,  and  the energy

of  discovery — the  stirring elements  of  that wondrous   spirit,
which,  clear, calm,  and  great, moved,  in  after  years,  through

deep onward  through  deep  of Nature's  mysteries,  unlocking  her
strongholds,  dispelling  darkness,  educing  order — everywhere   si
lently conquering.
   Newton  had  an  early and  decided  taste  for drawing.  Pictures,
taken  sometimes  from  copies, but  often  from   life, and  drawn,
coloured  and  framed  by  himself, ornamented  his apartment.  He

was  skilled  also,  in poetical  composition,  " excelled  in making
verses  ;" some  of these  were  borne  in remembrance  and  repeated,
seventy  years  afterward, by  Mrs.  Vincent,  for whom,  in early
youth,  as Miss  Storey,  he  formed  an  ardent  attachment.  She
was  the  sister  of  a physician  resident  near Woolsthorpe  ; but

Newton's  intimate  acquaintance  with  her  began  at Grantham.
where  they were  both numbered  among  the inmates  of the  same
house.  Two  or  three  years  younger  than  himself,  of great  per
sonal  beauty,  and  unusual  talent, her  society  afforded  him  the
greatest  pleasure  ; and  their  youthful  friendship,  it is believed,
gradually  rose  to  a higher  passion ; but  inadequacy  of  fortune
prevented  their union.  Miss  Storey  was  afterwards  twice  mar
ried ; Newton,  never;  his esteem  for her  continued  unabated
during  life, accompanied  by numerous  acts  of  attention  and
kindness.

   In 1656, Newton's  mother  was  again  left  a  widowr,  and  took
up her abode  once  more  at Woolsthorpe.  He  was  now   fifteen
years  of age, and  had made  great  progress  in his studies  ; but  she,
desirous  of his help, and  from  motives  of economy,  recalled  him
from  school.  Business  occupations,  however,  and  the manage
ment  of the farm, proved  utterly  distasteful  to him.  When   sent  to
Grantham  Market  on Saturdays,  he would  betake  himself  to  his

former  lodgings  in the  apothecary's  garret, where  some  of Mr.
Clark's  old books  employed  his thoughts   till the aged  and  trust
worthy  servant  had executed  the family commissions  and announced
the necessity  of return  :  or, at other  times,  our young  philosopher

 turned.  The  more  immediate  affairs  of the  farm  received  no
 better  attention.  In  fact, his passion  for study grew  daily more
 absorbing,  and  his  dislike  for  every  other  occupation  more  in
tense.  His  mother,  therefore,  wisely  resolved  to give him  all the
 advantages  which  an education  could  confer.  He  was  sent  back
 to Grantham  school, where  he remained  for some  months  in busy
preparation  for his academical  studies.  At  the recommendation
 of one  of his uncles, who  had  himself  studied  at Trinity  College,
Cambridge,  Newton  proceeded  thither, and  was  duly  admitted.
on  the  5th day  of June  1660,  in the eighteenth  year  of his  age.
   The  eager  student  had  now  entered  upon  a new  and  wider
 field ; and we  find him  devoting  himself  to the pursuit  of know
ledge  with  amazing  ardour  and perseverance.  Among  other  sub
jects, his attention  was  soon  drawn  to that  of Judicial  Astrology
He  exposed  the  folly of  this pseudo-science  by erecting  a figure
 with  the  aid  of one  or two  of the problems  of Euclid  ;— and  thus
began  his study  of the Mathematics.  His  researches  into  this
science  were  prosecuted  with  unparallelled  vigour  and  success.
Regarding  the  propositions  contained  in Euclid  as  self-evident
truths, he passed  rapidly  over  this ancient  system —  a step which
he afterward  much  regretted —  and mastered,  without  further  pre
paratory  study,  the Analytical  Geometry  of Descartes.  Wallis's
Arithmetic  of  Infinites, Saunderson's  Logic,  and  the  Optics  of
Kepler,  he  also  studied  with  great  care  ; writing  upon  them

many  comments  ; and,  in these  notes  on  Wallis's  work  was  un
doubtedly  the germ  of his fluxionary  calculus.  His  progress  was
so great  that  he found  himself  more  profoundly  versed  than  his tutor
in many  branches  of learning.  Yet  his  acquisitions  were  not
gotten  with  the  rapidity  of intuition  ; but  they were  thoroughly
made  and  firmly secured.  Quickness  of apprehension,  or  Intel
lectual nimbleness  did  not belong  to him.  He  saw  too  far : his,
insight was  too deep.  He  dwelt  fully, cautiously  upon  the  least
subject  ; while  to the consideration  of the  greatest,  he brought   a
massive  strength  joined  with  a matchless  clearness,  that, regard
less  of the merely  trivial  or unimportant,  bore  with  unerring  sa
gacity upon  the prominences  of  the  subject,  and, grappling  with
its difficulties,  rarely  failed  to surmount  them.

| absorbing, and | his dislike | for every other | occu | pation more in |

| advantages whic | h an educat | ion could confe | r. He | was sent back |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| to Grantham sc | hool, where | he remained for | some | months in busy |
| preparation for | his academic | al studies. At | the | recommendation |

| Cambridge, Ne | wton proce | eded thither, an | d was | duly admitted. |
| on the 5th day | of June 166 | 0, in the eighte | enth y | ear of his age. |
| The eager st | udent had | now entered up | on a | new and wider |
| field ; and we f | ind him devo | ting himself to | the p | ursuit of know |

|  |  |  |  |  |
| jects, his attenti | on was soon | drawn to that | of Jud | icial Astrology |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| He exposed the | folly of th | is pseudo-science | by | erecting a figure |
| with the aid of | one or two | of the problems | of Euc | lid ;— and thus |
| began his study | of the Mat | hematics. His | rese | arches into this |
| science were pr | osecuted wi | th unparallelled | vigo | ur and success. |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Regarding the | propositions | contained in E | uclid | as self-evident |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| truths, he passed | rapidly ov | er this ancient | system | — a step which |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| he afterward mu | ch regrette | d — and mastered, | with | out further pre |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| paratory study, | the Analyti | cal Geometry of | Desc | artes. Wallis's |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Arithmetic of | Infinites, Sa | underson's Logi | c, and | the Optics of |
| Kepler, he also | studied w | ith great care | ; writ | ing upon them |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| many comments | ; and, in t | hese notes on W | allis' | s work was un |
| doubtedly the g | erm of his f | luxionary calcul | us. H | is progress was |
| so great that he f | ound himself | more profoundly | verse | d than his tutor |

   His  early and  fast friend, Dr. Barrow —  in compass  of  inven
tion only  inferior  to Newton — who  had  been  elected  Professor
of Greek  in the University,  in 1660,  was  made  Lucasian  Profes
sor  of Mathematics  in  1663,  and  soon  afterward  delivered  his
Optical  Lectures  : the manuscripts  of these  were  revised  by New
ton, and  several  oversights  corrected,  and  many  important  sug
gestions made  by him  ; but  they were  not published  till 1669.
   In the year  1665,  he received  the degree  of Bachelor  of Arts ;
and,  in 1666,  he entered  upon  those  brilliant  and  imposing  dis
coveries  which  have  conferred  inappreciable  benefits  upon  science,
and  immortality  upon  his own  name.
  Newton,  himself,  states  that  he was  in possession  of his Method

of Fluxions,  " in the year  1666,  or before."  Infinite  quantities
had  long been  a subject  of profound  investigation  ; among  the
ancients  by Archimedes,  and  Pappus  of Alexandria  ; among  the
moderns  by  Kepler,  Cavaleri,  Roberval,  Fermat  and  Wallis.
With  consummate  ability Dr.  Wallis  had  improved  upon  the  la-
hours  of his predecessors  : with  a higher  power, Newton  moved
forwards  from  where  Wallis stopped.  Our  author  first invented
his celebrated  BINOMIAL  THEOREM.  And  then,  applying  this
Theorem   to the  rectification  of curves,  and  to  the determination
of the  surfaces  and  contents  of  solids, and  the  position  of  their
centres  of gravity,  he discovered  the general  principle  of deducing
the  areas  of curves  from  the  ordinate, by considering  the  area  as
a nascent  quantity,  increasing  by continual  fluxion  in the propor
tion  of the  length  of the  ordinate, and  supposing  the  abscissa
to increase  uniformly  in proportion  to the time.  Regarding  lines
as generated  by  the motion  of  points,  surfaces  by the  motion  of
lines, and  solids by  the motion  of  surfaces, and  considering  that
the  ordinates,  abscissae,  &c.,  of curves  thus  formed,  vary  accord
ing  to  a regular  law  depending  on the  equation  of the  curve,
he  deduced  from  this equation  the  velocities  with  which  these
quantities  are  generated,  and  obtained  by  the  rules  of  infinite
series, the  ultimate  value required.  To  the  velocities  with  which
every  line or  quantity  is generated,  he  gave  the name  of FLUX
IONS,  and  to the  lines  or quantities  themselves,  that  of FLUENTS.

   At  this period,  the most  distinguished  philosophers  were  direct
ing  all their  energies  to the  subject  of light and  the improvement

the grinding  of "optic  glasses  of other  figures  than  spherical,"  ex

jectured  that  their  defects, and  consequently  those  of  refracting
telescopes,  might  arise from  some  other  cause  than  the imperfect

convergency  of rays  to  a single point.  He  accordingly  "procured
a triangular  glass prism  to try therewith  the  celebrated  phenom

ena  of colours."  His  experiments,  entered  upon  with  zeal, and
conducted  with  that  industry,  accuracy,  and  patient  thought,  for
which  he  was  so  remarkable,  resulted  in  the grand  conclusion,
that LIGHT  WAS  NOT  HOMOGENEOUS,  BUT  CONSISTED  OF  RAYS,
SOME  OF WHICH  WERE  MORE   REFRANGIBLE     THAN    OTHERS.      This

profound  and  beautiful  discovery  opened  up  a  new  era  in the
History  of Optics.  As bearing, however,  directly upon  the construc
tion  of telescopes,  he saw  that  a lens refracting  exactly  like  a prism
would  necessarily  bring  the  different  rays  to  different  foci, at
different  distances  from  the  glass, confusing  and  rendering  the
vision  indistinct.  Taking  for granted  that  all bodies  produced
spectra  of  ^ jtial length,  he dismissed  all further  consideration  of
the  refracting  instrument,  and  took  up  the  principle  of  reflection.
Rays  of  all colours,  he found,  were  reflected  regularly,  so that the
angle  of reflection  was  equal  to the angle  of incidence,  and hence
he concluded  that  ojitical instruments  might  be brought  to any
degree  of perfection  imaginable,  provided  reflecting  specula  of
the  requisite  figure and  finish  could  be obtained.  At  this  stage
of his optical  researches,  he was  forced  to leave Cambridge   on

he passed  his days  in serene  contemplation,  while  the  stalking
pestilence  was  hurrying  its tens  of thousands  into undistinguisha       •
ble graves.
  Towards  the  close  of  a  pleasant  day  in the  early autumn  of
1666,  he was  seated  alone  beneath  a tree,  in his garden,  absorbed
in meditation.  He  was  a  slight young  man  ; in the twenty-fourth
year  of his age ; his countenance  mild  and  full of thought.  For
a century  previous,  the  science  of Astronomy  had  advanced  with
rapid strides.  The  human  mind  had  risen  from  the gloom  and
bondage  of the middle  ages,  in unparalleled  vigour,  to unfold  the
system,  to investigate  the phenomena,  and  to  establish  the laws
of  the  heavenly  bodies.  Copernicus,  Tycho  Brahe,  Kepler,
Galileo,  and  others  had  prepared  and  lighted  the way  for him
who  was  ta give  to  their labour  its just value, and  to their genius
its true lustre.  At  his bidding  isolated  facts were  to take  order
as parts  of one harmonious  whole,  and  sagacious  conjectures  grow
luminous  in the certain  splendour  of demonstrated  truth.  And
this ablest man  had  come — was  here.  His  mind,  familiar  with
the knowledge  of past  effort, and  its unequalled  faculties develop
ed  in transcendant  strength, was  now  moving  on  to  the  very
threshold  of Its grandest achievement.  Step by  step  the untrod
den  path was  measured,   till, at  length, the  entrance  seemed  dis
closed,  and  the  tireless explorer  to stand amid  the  first opening
wonders  of the  universe.

   The  nature  of gravity — that  mysterious  power  which  causes
all bodies  to descend  towards  the  centre  of the  earth — had,  in
deed, dawned  upon him.  And  reason  busily united  link  to link
of that chain  which  was  yet  to be traced  joining  the  least  to the
vastest,  the most  remote  to the nearest,  in one harmonious  bond.
From  the bottoms  of the deepest  caverns  to the summits  of  the
highest  mountains,  this power  suffers  no  sensible  change  : may  not
its action, then, extend  to the moon ?  Undoubtedly   : and  furthei
reflection  convinced  him  that  such  a power  might  be  .sufficient  for
retaining  that luminary  in her  orbit  round  the earth.  But, though
this power  suffers  no  sensible  variation,  in the  little change  of

more  or  less diminution ?  The  conjecture  appeared  most  proba
ble  : and,  in order  to  estimate  what  the  degree  of diminution
might  be, he considered  that  if the moon  be retained  in her  orbit
by  the  force  of gravity,  the primary  planets  must  also be  carried
round  the  sun by  the  like power;  and, by comparing  the periods
of the  several  planets  with  their  distances  from  the  sun, he found
that,  if they were  held  in their  courses  by any power  like gravity,
its strength  must  decrease  in the duplicate  proportion  of the  in
crease  of distance.  In forming  this conclusion,  he  supposed  the
planets  to move  in perfect  circles, concentric  to  the sun.  Now

was  this the law  of the moon's  motion ?  Was  such  a force, em
anating  from  the  earth  and  directed  to the moon,  sufficient, when
diminished  as the  square  of the  distance,  to  retain  her  in her
orbit ?  To  ascertain  this  master-fact,  he compared  the  space
through  which  heavy  bodies  fall, in a second  of  time,  at  a given
distance  from  the  centre  of the  earth, namely,  at  its surface,  with
the space  through  which  the moon   falls, as  it were,  to the  earth,
in the same  time, while  revolving  in  a  circular  orbit.  He  was
absent  from  books  ; and,  therefore,  adopted,  in computing  the

earth's  diameter,  the common  estimate  of sixty  miles  to  a degree
of  latitude  as  then  in  use  among  geographers  and  navigators.
The  result of  his calculations  did  not, ot  course,  answer  his ex
pectations  ; hence,  he concluded  that some  other  cause, beyond  the
reach  of observation —  analogous,  perhaps,  to the  vortices  of Des
cartes — joined  its action  to that  of the power  of gravity  upon  the
rnooil.  Though  by  no  means  satisfied, he  yet abandoned  awhile
further  inquiry,  and remained  totally  silent upon  the  subject.
  These  rapid marches  in the career  of discovery,  combined  with
the youth  of Newton,  seem  to evince  a  penetration  the  most
lively, and  an invention  the  most  exuberant.  But  in him  there
was  a  conjunction  of  influences  as  extraordinary  as  fortunate.
Study,  unbroken,  persevering  and  profound  carried  on  its inform
ing  and  disciplining work  upon  a genius,  natively  the  greatest,
and  rendered  freest  in its movements,  and  clearest  in  its  vision,
through  the untrammelling  and  enlig} tenirig power  of  religion.
And,  in this happy  concurrence,  are  to be sought  the elements  of
those  amazing   abilities, which,  grasping,  with  equal  facility, the

| by the for | ce of gr | avity, the | primary planets | must also | be carried |
| round the | sun by | the like p | ower; and, by | comparing | the periods |
| of the seve | ral pla | nets with | their distances f | rom the sun | , he found |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that, if the | y were | held in th | eir courses by a | ny power li | ke gravity, |
| its strengt | h must | decrease i | n the duplicate | proportion | of the in |
| crease of | distance | . In form | ing this conclusi | on, he sup | posed the |
| planets to | move i | n perfect c | ircles, concentri | c to the | sun. Now |

minute  and  the  stupendous,  brought  these  successively  to  light,
and  caused  science  to make  them  her  own.
   In 1667, Newton  was  made  a Junior  Fellow  ; and,  in the year
following,  he  took  his degree  of Master  of Arts, and  was  appoint
ed  to a Senior  Fellowship.
  On  his return  to Cambridge,  in 1668,  he resumed  his  optical
labours.  Having  thought  of a delicate method  of polishing  metal,
he proceeded  to the construction  of his newly  projected  reflect
ing telescope  ; a small  specimen  of which  he  actually made  with
his own  hands,  It was  six  inches  long  ; and  magnified  about
forty times  ;—  a power  greater  than  a refracting  instrument  of six
feet tube  could  exert  with  distinctness.  Jupiter,  with  his  four
satellites, and  the  horns,  or  moon-like  phases  of Venus  were
plainly visible  through  it. THIS  WAS  THE  FIRST  REFLECTING
TELESCOPE      EVER    EXECUTED      AND    DIRECTED       TO    THE   HEAVENS.
He  gave  an account  of it, in a letter  to a friend, dated  February  23d,

1668-9 —  a letter which  is also remarkable  for containing  the  firs'
allusion  to his discoveries  " concerning  the nature  of light."  En
couraged  by  the  success  of his  first experiment,  he again executed
with  his own  hands,  not  long  afterward,  a  second  and  superior
instrument  of the same  kind.  The  existence  of this having come
to the knowledge  of the Royal  Society  of London,  in 1671,  they
requested  it of Newton   for examination.  He  accordingly  sent  it

to them,   It excited  great admiration;   it was  shown  to the king*
a drawing  and  description  of  it was  sent  to Paris  ; and  the  tele-
scope  itself was  carefully  preserved  in the Library  of the Society.
Newton  lived  to  see  his invention  in public  use, and  of eminent
service  in the  cause  of science.
   In the  spring  of  1669,  he wrote  to his friend  Francis  Aston,
Esq., then  about  setting  out  on  his travels,  a letter  of advice  and
directions,  it was  dated May  18th,  and  is interesting  as exhibit

ing some  of  the  prominent  features  in Newton's  character.
Thus   :—

which,  I  bolieA  e, you  have  considered  already ; but  if any  of
them  be new  to you, they may  excuse  the  rest ; if none  at  all,
yet  is my  punishment  more  in writing  than  yours  in reading.

 "When  you come  into  any fresh company.   1. Observe  their
humours.  2.  Suit your  own  carriage  thereto, by which  insinua
tion you  will make  their converse  more  free  and  open.  3. Let
your  discourse  be more  in queries  and  doubtings  than peremptory
assertions  or disputings,  it being  the  design  of travellers  to learn,
not  to teach.  Besides,  it will persuade  your  acquaintance  that
you  have  the greater esteem  of  them,  and  so make  them  more
ready  to communicate  what  they know  to you  ; whereas  nothing
sooner  occasions  disrespect  and  quarrels  than  peremptoriness.
You  will  find  little  or  no advantage  in seeming  wiser  or much
more  ignorant  than  your company.  4. Seldom  discommend  any
thing though  never  so  bad,  or do  it but moderately,  lest you  be
unexpectedly  forced  to  an unhandsome  retraction.  It is safer  to
commend  any  thing  more  than  it deserves,  than  to discommend
a  thing  so much  as  it deserves;  for commendations  meet  not
so  often  with  oppositions,  or, at  least, are  not  usually  so  ill re
sented  by men  that  think  otherwise,  as discommendations  ; and

you  will  insinuate  into men's  favour  by nothing  sooner  than  seem
ing  to approve  and commend  what  they  like ; but  beware   o
doing  it by comparison.  5.  If you  be  affronted,  it is better,  in   c
foreign  country,  to pass  it by  in silence, and  with  a  jest, though
with  some  dishonour,  than  to endeavour  revenge  ; for, in the  first

case,  your  credit's  ne'er  the worse  when  you  return  into England,
or come  into other company  that have  not heard  of the  quarrel.
But,  in the  second  case, you  may  bear  the marks  of  the  quarrel
while  you  live,  if you  outlive  it at all.  But,  if you  find yoursell

unavoidably  engaged,  'tis best,  I think,  if you  can command  your
passion  and  language,  to keep  them  pretty  evenly  at some  certain
moderate  pitch,  not much  heightening  them  to exasperate  your
adversary,  or provoke  his friends,  nor  letting them  grow  overmuch
dejected  to make  him  insult.  In  a word,  if you  can keep  reason
above  passion,  that  and  watchfulness  will be your  best defendants.
To  which  purpose  you  may  consider,  that, though  such  excuses

 is this — He  provok't  me  so much  I could  not  forbear — may  pass

   " To  these  I may  add  some  general  heads  for  inquiries  or ob
servations,  such  as  at present  I can  think on.  As,  1. To  observe
the  policies, wealth,  and  state  affairs  of  nations,  so  far  as  a  soli-

all sorts  of people,  trades,  or  commodities,  that  are  remarkable.
3. Their  laws  and  customs, how  far they  differ from  ours.  4.
Their  trades  and  arts wherein  they  excel  or come  short  of  us  in
England.  5. Such  fortifications  as you  shall meet  with,  their
fashion,  strength,  and  advantages  for defence,  and  other  such  mili
tary  affairs  as  are considerable.  6. The  power  and  respect  be
longing  to their degrees  of nobility  or magistracy.  7.  It will not
be time  misspent  to make  a catalogue  of the names  and  excellen
cies  of those  men  that  are  most  wise, learned,  or esteemed  in any
nation.  8. Observe  the mechanism  and manner  of guiding  ships.
9. Observe  the products  of Nature  in several  places, especially  in
mines,  with  the circumstances  of mining  and  of extracting  metals
or minerals   out  of  their  ore, and  of refining  them  ; and  if you
meet  with  any  transmutations    out   of  their  own    species    into
another  (as out  of iron  into copper,  out  of any  metal  into  quick
silver, out  of one  salt into another,  or into  an insipid  body,  &c.),
those, above  all, will be worth  your  noting,  being  the most  lucif-
erous,  and many  times  lucriferous  experiments,  too, in philosophy.
10.  The   prices  of  diet  and  other  things.     11. And  the  staple
commodities  of places.

nitium,  in Hungary  (where  there  are  mines  of gold, copper,  iron,
vitriol, antimony,  &c.). they change  iron  into copper  by dissolving
»t in a vitriolate  water,  which  they  find  in cavities  of rocks  in the
mines,  and  then  melting  the slimy  solution  in a  stroi ig fire, which
in the  cooling  proves  copper.  The  like  is said  to be done  in other
places, which  I cannot  now  remember  ; perhaps,  too,  it may  be

a certain  vitriol came  from  thence  (called Roman   vitriol),  but of
a nobler  virtue  than  that which  is now  called  by that  name  ;
which  vitriol  is not now  to be gotten,  because,  perhaps,  they make
a greater  gain by some  such  trick  as  turning  iron  into  copper
with  it than by  selling it.  2. Whether,  in Hungary,  Sclavonia,
Bohemia,  near  the town  Eila, or  at the  mountains  of Bohemia
near  Silesia, there  be  rivers whose  waters  are impregnated  with
gold  ; perhaps,  the gold being  dissolved  by some  corrosive  water
like aqua  regis,  and  the  solution  carried  along with  the  stream,
that  runs  through  the mines.  And  whether  the practice  of laying
mercury  in the  rivers,  till it be tinged  with  gold, and  then  strain
ing the mercury  through  leather,  that  the gold may  stay behind,
be  a  secret  yet,  or  openly  practised.  3. There  is newly  con
trived, in  Holland,  a  mill  to  grind  glasses  plane  withal,  and  I
think  polishing  them  too  ; perhaps  it will be worth  the while  to  see
it.   4. There  is in Holland  one        Borry, who  some  years  since
was  imprisoned  by  the Pope,  to have  extorted  from  him  secrets
(as I am  told)  of great  worth,  both  as to medicine  and  profit, but
he escaped  into Holland,  where  they have  granted  him  a  guard.
I think  he  usually  goes  clothed  in green.  Pray  inquire what  you
can  of him,  and  whether  his ingenuity  be  any  profit  to the Dutch.
You  may  inform  yourself whether  the Dutch  have  any  tricks  to
keep  their  ships from  being  all worm-eaten  in  their  voyages  to
the Indies.  Whether  pendulum  clocks  do any  service  in  finding
out  the longitude,  &c.
   " I am  very  weary,  and  shall  not  stay  to  part with  a  long
compliment,  only  I wish  you  a good  journey,  and  God  be with

 you."It was  not  till the month  of June,  1669,  that  our  author  made
known   his Method  of Fluxions.  He  then  communicated   the
work  which  he  had  composed  upon  the  subject, and  entitled,
ANALYSIS  PER EQUATIONES  NUMERO  TERMINORUM  INFINITAS,
to his friend  Dr. Barrow.  The  latter,  in a letter dated  20th  of the
same  month,  mentioned   it to Mr.  Collins, and  transmitted  it to
him,  on  the  31st  of July thereafter.  Mr.  Collins  greatly  approv>

 Collins, by  his extensive  correspondence,  spread  the knowledge
 of this discovery among  the mathematicians   in England,  Scotland,
 France,  Holland  and  Italy.
   Dr. Barrow,  having  resolved  to devote  himself  to Theology,
resigned  the Lucasian  Professorship  of Mathematics,  in 1669,  in
favour  of Newton,  who  accordingly  received  the appointment  to
the vacant  chair.

   During  the years  1669,  1670,  and  1671,  our  author,  as  such
Professor,  delivered   a course  of Optical Lectures.  Though  these
contained  his principal  discoveries  relative  to  the  different  re-
frangibility  of  light, yet  the  discoveries  themselves  did  not be
come  publicly known,  it seems,  till he communicated  them  to the
Royal  Society,  a few  weeks  after being  elected  a member  there
of, in the  spring  of 1671-2.  He  now  rose  rapidly  in reputation,
and  was  soon  regarded  as foremost  among  the philosophers  of the
age.  His  paper  on  light excited  the deepest  interest  in the Royal
Society, who  manifested  an anxious  solicitude  to secure  the author

from  the  " arrogations  of  others," and  proposed  to  publish  his
discourse  in the monthly  numbers  in which  the Transactions  were
given  to the world.  Newton,  gratefully  sensible  of these expres
sions  of esteem,  willingly accepted  of the proposal  for publication.
He  gave  them  also,  at this time,  the  results  of some  further  ex
periments  in the decomposition  and re-composition  of light  :—  that
the same  degree  of  refrangibility always  belonged  to  the  same
colour,  and  the same  colour  to the same  degree  of refrangibility  :
that  the seven  different  colours  of the spectrum  were  original,  or
simple,  and  that whiteness^  or white  light was  a compound   of all
these  seven  colours.

  The  publication  of his new  doctrines  on  light soon  called  forth
violent  opposition  as  to their soundness.  Hooke  and Huygens —
men  eminent  for ability and  learning — were  the most  conspicuous
of the assailants.  And  though  Newton  effectually  silenced  all his
adversaries,  yet he  felt the triumph  of  little gain  in comparison
.vith the  loss  his tranquillity  had  sustained.  He  subsequently  re-
 narked  in allusion  to  this controversy — and  to  one  with whom
he was  destined  to have  a longer  and  a bitterer  conflict —  " I was

theory  ot  light, that  I blamed  my  own  imprudence  for  parting
with  so  substantial  a blessing  as rny quiet  to run  after  a shadow.7'
   In a communication  to Mr.  Oldenburg,  Secretary  of the Royal
Society,  in 1672,  our  author  stated many  valuable  suggestions  re
lative  to the construction  of REFLECTING  MICROSCOPES  which  he
considered  even  more  capable  of improvement  than  telescopes.
He  also contemplated,  about  the same  time,  an  edition  of Kirick-
huysen's  Algebra,  with  notes  and  additions;  partially  arranging,
as an introduction  to the work,  a treatise,  entitled, A  Method  of
Fluxions  ; but he  finally abandoned  the  design.  This  treatise,
however,  he  resolved,  or  rather  consented,  at a late period  of his
life, to put  forth  separately  ; and  the plan would  probably  have
been  carried  into execution  had  riot his death intervened.   It was
translated  into English,  and  published  in 1736  by John  Colson,
Professor  of Mathematics  in Cambridge.
  Newton,  it is thought, made  his  discoveries  concerning  the
INFLECTION  and DIFFRACTION  of  light before 1674.  The  phe
nomena  of the  inflection  of  light had  been  first discovered  more
than  ten years  before  by Grimaldi.  And  Newton  began  by  re
peating  one  of  the experiments  of  the learned  Jesuit — admitting
a beam  of the  sun's  light through  a small  pin hole  into  a dark
chamber  : the  light diverged  from  the aperture  in the  form  of   a,
cone,  and  the shadows  of  all bodies  placed  in  this  light were
larger  than  might  have  been  expected,  and surrounded  with  three
coloured  fringes,  the  nearest  being  widest,  and  the most  remote
the narrowest.  Newton,  advancing  upon  this experiment,  took
exact  measures  of  the diameter  of  the shadow  of  a human   hair,
and  of the breadth  of  the  fringes,  at different  distances  behind   it,
and  discovered  that  these  diameters  and  breadths  were  not  pro
portional  to  the  distances  at which  they were  measured.  He
hence  supposed  that  the  rays which  passed  by the  edge  of  the
hair were  deflected  or turned  aside  from  it, as  if by  a  repulsive
force, the  nearest  rays  suffering  the  greatest,  the more  remote   a
less degree  of deflection.  In explanation  of the coloured  fringes,
he queried  : whether  the  rays which  differ  in refrangibility  do  not
 differ  also  in flexibility, and  whether  they  are  n<»t, by these  dif
 ferent  inflections, separated  from  one  another,  so  as  after  separa-

 tion  to make  the  colours  in the  three  fringes  above  described  ?
 Also, whether  the  rays, in passing  by the  edges  and  sides  ol
 bodies,  are  not  bent  several  times backwards  and  forwards  with
 an  eel-like  motion — the  three  fringes  arising from  three  such
 bendings ?  His  inquiries  on  this  subject were  here  interrupted
 and  fiever  renewed.

   His Theory  of the COLOURS  of NATURAL  BODIES  was commu
nicated  to the Royal  Society,  in February,  1675.  This  is justly
regarded  as one  of the profoundest  of his speculations.  The  fun
damental  principles  of the  Theory  in  brief,  are  :— That  bodies
possessing  the  greatest  refractive  powers  reflect  the  greatest
quantity  of light ; and  that,  at the  confines  of equally  refracting
media,  there  is no  reflection.  That  the  minutest  particles  of  al
most  all natural  bodies  are  in some  degree  transparent.  That
between  the  particles  of bodies  there  are  pores,  or  spaces,  either
empty  or filled with  media  of a  less  density  than  the  particles
themselves.  That  these  particles,  and  pores  or  spaces,  have  some
definite size.  Hence  he deduced  the Transparency,  Opacity,  and
colours  of natural bodies.  Transparency  arises from  the particles
and  their pores  being  too  small  to cause  reflection  at  their  com
mon  surfaces — the  light  all passing  through  ; Opacity  from  the
opposite  cause  of  the  particles  and  their pores  being  sufficiently

large  to  reflect  the  light which   is " stopped  or  stifled7' by  the
multitude  of reflections  ; and  colours  from  the  particles, accord
ing to their  several  sizes, reflecting  rays  of one  colour  and  trans
mitting  those  of another — or  in  other  words,  the  colour  that
meets  the eye  is the  colour  reflected,  while  all the  other  rays  are
transmitted  or absorbed.
  Analogous  in origin  to the  colours  of natural  bodies,  he  con
sidered  the COLOURS  OF  THIN  PLATES.  This  subject  was  interest
ing and  important,  and  had  attracted  considerable  investigation.
He, however,  was  the  first to determine  the  law  of the  produc
tion  of these  colours,  arid, during  the  same  year made  known  the
results  of his researches  herein  to the Royal  Society.  His mode
of procedure  in these  experiments  was  simple  and  curious.  He
placed  a double  convex  lens  of a large known  radius  of curvature,
      the  flat surface  of a plano-convex  object glass.  Thus,  from

| His Theor | y of the | COLOUR | S of NA | TURAL BODIES | was commu |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| nicated to th | e Royal | Society | , in Febr | uary, 1675. | This is justly |
| regarded as o | ne of th | e profo | undest of | his speculatio | ns. The fun |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| damental pri | nciples | of the | Theory | in brief, are :— | That bodies |
| possessing t | he great | est ref | ractive p | owers reflect | the greatest |
| quantity of l | ight ; an | d that, | at the co | nfines of equal | ly refracting |
| media, there | is no re | flection | . That t | he minutest pa | rticles of al |
| most all natur | al bodi | es are | in some | degree transp | arent. That |
| between the | particles | of bodi | es there | are pores, or | spaces, either |
| empty or fill | ed with | media | of a les | s density than | the particles |
| themselves. | That th | ese part | icles, and | pores or space | s, have some |
| definite size. | Hence | he ded | uced the | Transparency, | Opacity, and |
| colours of nat | ural bo | dies. T | ransparen | cy arises from | the particles |
| and their por | es being | too sm | all to cau | se reflection a | t their com |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| mon surfaces | — the l | ight all | passing | through ; O pac | ity from the |
| opposite caus | e of the | particl | es and th | eir pores bein | g sufficiently |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| large to refl | ect the | light | which is | " stopped or st | ifled7' by the |
| multitude of | reflection | s ; and | colours | from the parti | cles, accord |
| ing to their s | everal si | zes, ref | lecting ra | ys of one colou | r and trans |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| mitting those | of ano | ther — | or in oth | er words, the | colour that |
| meets the eye | is the | colour r | eflected, | while all the o | ther rays are |
| transmitted o | r absorbe | d. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Analogous | in origi | n to the | colours | of natural bo | dies, he con |
| sidered the C | OLOURS | OF THIN | PLATES. | This subject | was interest |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| of procedure | in these | experim | ents was | simple and | curious. He |

 their point  of contact  at the  centre,  to the  circumference  of  the
lens, he  obtained  plates  of  air, or  spaces  varying  from  the  ex-
tremest  possible  thinness, by slow  degrees,  to  a considerable  thick
ness.  Letting  the  light  fall, every  different  thickness  of  this
plate  of air gave  different  colours — the  point  of contact  of  the
lens and  glass forming  the  centre  of numerous  concentric  colored
nags.  Now  the  radius  of curvature  of the  lens  being known,  the
thickness  of the plate  of  air, at any  given  point,  or where  any  par
ticular  colour  appeared,  could  be exactly determined.  Carefully
noting,  therefore,  the  order  in which  the  different  colours  ap
peared,  he measured,  with  the  nicest  accuracy,  the  different  thick*
nesses  at which  the most  luminous  parts  of the  rings  were  pro
duced,  whether  the medium  were  air, water,  or mica —  all these
substances  giving  the same  colours  at different  thicknesses  ;—  the
ratio  of which  he  also ascertained.  From  the phenomena  obser
ved  in these  experiments,  Newton  deduced  his Theory  of Fits  of
EASY  REFLECTION  AND TRANSMISSION   of light.  It consists  in suppos
ing that every  particle  of light, from  its first discharge  from  a lumi
nous  body,  possesses,  at equally  distant  intervals,  dispositions  to
be reflected  from,  or transmitted  through  the  surfaces  of bodies
upon  which  it may  fall.  For  instance,  if the  rays  are  in a Fit  of
Easy  Reflection,  they  are  on  reaching  the  surface,  repelled,
thrown  off] or  reflected  from  it ; if, in a Fit  of Easy  Transmission,
they  are  attracted, drawn  in, or transmitted  through  it. By  this
Theory  of  Fits, our  author  likewise  explained  the  colours  of
thick  plates.
  He  regarded  light  as  consisting  of  small  material  particles
emitted  from  shining substances.  He  thought  that  these  parti
cles could  be re-combined  into  solid matter,  so that  " gross bodies
and  light, were  convertible  into  one  another  ;" that  the particles  of
light and  the  particles  of  solid  bodies  acted  mutually  upon  each
other ; those  of light agitating  and  heating  those  of  solid  bodies,
and  the  latter attracting  and  repelling  the former.  Newton  was
the  first to suggest  the  idea  of the POLARIZATION   of light.
   In the paper  entitled An  Hypothesis  Explaining  Properties  of
Light, December,  1675,  our  author  first introduced  his opinions  re
specting  Ether —  opinions  which  he afterward  abandoned  and  again

   One  of the most  curious  of Newton's  minor  inquiries  related  to
the connexion  between  the  refractive  powers  and  chemical  com
position  of bodies.  He  found  on comparing  the  refractive  powers

 were  very  nearly  proportional  to the  latter, in the  same  bodies.
 Unctuous  and sulphureous  bodies  were  noticed  as remarkable  excep

 or three  times  greater  in respect  of  their  densities  than  in  the
 case  of other  substances,  while,  as among  themselves,  the  one  was
 generally  proportional  to the other.  He  hence  inferred  as  to the
 diamond   a great degree  of combustibility   •;—  a conjecture  which
 the experiments  of modern  chemistry  have  shown  to be  true.

 serted  iii the Philosophical  Transactions  ; it contains  a compara

mechanical  phenomena   of cohesion  and  capillary  attraction.   New

his reply, dated  June  30th,  16(Jl, narrates  the  following  circum
stances,  which  probably  took  place  in  the course  of his  optical
researches.  Thus   :—

   " The  observation  you  mention  in Mr.  Boyle's Book  of Colours
I once  tried upon  myself  with  the  hazard  of my  eyes.  The
manner  was  this ; I looked  a very  little while  upon  the sun  in the
looking-glass  with my  right  eye,  and  then  turned  my  eyes  into  a
dark  corner  of my  chamber,  arid winked,  to observe  the  impres
sion made,  and  the  circles  of colours  which  encompassed   it, and
how  they decayed  by degrees,  and  at last vanished.  This  I  re
peated  a second  and  a third time.  At  the  third  time, when  the
phantasm  of light and  colours  about  it were  almost  vanished,  in
tending my  fancy upon  them  to  see  their  last appearance,  I found,
to my  amazement,  that they began  to  return, and  by  little and
little to become  as lively and  vivid  as when  I had  newly  looked
upon  the sun.  But  when  I ceased  to intend my  fancy upon  them,
they vanished  again.  After  this, I found,  that  as  often  as I went
into  the  dark,  and  intended  my  mind  upon  them,  as when   a man
looks  earnestly  to  see anything  which  is difficult  to be  seen, I
could  make  the phantasm  return  without  looking  any more  upon
the  sun  ; and  the  oftener  I made   it return,  the more  easily  I could
make   it return  again.  And,  at length, by repeating  this, without
looking  any  more  upon  the  sun, I made  such  an impression  on my
eye,  that,  if I looked  upon  the  clouds,  or  a book,  or  any  bright
object,  I saw  upon  it a round  bright  spot  of light  like  the  sun,
and, which  is still stranger, though  I looked  upon  the  sun  with
my  right eye  only, and  not  with my  left, yet my  fancy began  *o
make  an impression  upon my  left eye,  as well  us upon  my  right.
For  if I shut my  right  eye,  or looked  upon  a book,  or the clouds,
with my  left eye,  I could  see  the spectrum  of the  sun  almost  as
plain  as with my  right eye,  if I did  but  intend my  fancy  a little
while  upon  it ; for at  first, if I shut my  right  eye,  and  looked  with
my  left, the spectrum  of the  sun  did  not appear  till I intended my
fancy upon  it ; but by repeating,  this appeared  every  time  more

easily.  And  now,  in a few  hours'  time,  I had  brought  my  eyes
to such  a pass,  that  I could  look  upon  no blight  object  with  either
eye, but  I saw  the  sun  before  me,  so  that  I durst  neither  write

| tending my f | ancy u | pon them | to s | ee their last | appearance, | I found, |

nor  read  ; but  to recover  the  use  of my  eyes,  shut  myself  up  in
my  chamber  made  dark,  for three  days  together,  and  used  all
means  to divert my  imagination  from  the sun.  For  if I thought
upon  him,  I presently  saw  his  picture, though  I was  in the  dark.
But by keeping  in the  dark,  and employing  my  mind  about  other
things,  I began  in three  or four days  to have  some  use  of my  eyes
again ; and by forbearing  to look upon  bright  objects, recovered
them  pretty  well, though  not  so well  but  that, for some  months
after, the spectrum  of the  sun began  to return  as often  as I began
to meditate  upon  the phenomena,  even  though  I lay in bed  at mid
night  with my  curtains drawn.  But  now  I have  been  very  well
for many  years, though  I am  apt  to think,  if I durst  venture  my
eyes,  I could  still make  the phantasm  return  by  the power  of my
fancy.  This  story  I tell you,  to  let you  understand,  thaj; in the

observation  related by Mr.  Boyle,  the  man's  fancy probably  con
curred  with  the  impression  made  by  the  sun's  light  to produce
that phantasm  of the  sun  which  he constantly  saw  in bright  ob
jects. And  so your  question  about  the  cause  of phantasm  in
volves  another  about  the power  of fancy, which  I must  confess  is
too hard  a knot  for me  to untie.  To  place  this effect  in a constant
motion  is hard, because  the  sun  ought  then  to appear  perpetually.
It seems  rather  to consist  in a disposition  of  the  sensorium   to
move  the imagination  strongly,  and  to be  easily moved,  both  by
the imagination  and by the  light,  as often  as  bright  objects  are

looked  upon."J  Though  Newton  had  continued  silent, yet  his thoughts  were
by  no means  inactive  upon  the  vast  subject  of  the planetary  mo
tions.  The  idea  of Universal  Gravitation,  first caught  sight  of, so
to speak,  in the garden  at Woolsthorpe,  years  ago, had  gradually
expanded  upon him.  We   find  him,  in a  letter  to  Dr.  Hooke,
Secretary  of the Royal  Society,  dated  in November,  1679,  pro
posing  to verify the  motion  of the  earth  by direct  experiment,
namely,  by  the observation  of the path pursued  by  a body  falling
from  a considerable  height.  He  had  concluded  that  the  path

the discovery  that  a projectile would  move   in an  elliptical  orbil
when  under  the  influence  of a  force varying  inversely  as  the

square  of the  distance, was  led  to discover  " the  theorem  bj
which  he afterwards  examined  the  ellipsis ;" and  to demonstrate
the celebrated  proposition  that  a planet  acted  upon  by  an  attrac
tive  force  varying  inversely  as the squares  of the  distances  will
describe  an  elliptical  orbit, in one  of whose  foci the  attractive
force  resides.
  When  he was  attending  a meeting  of the  Royal  Society,  in
June  1682,  the conversation  fell upon  the  subject  of the measure
ment  of a degree  of the  meridian,  executed  by M.  Picard,  a
French  Astronomer,  in 1679.  Newton  took  a memorandum   oi
the  result  ; and  afterward,  at  the  earliest  opportunity,  computed
from  it the diameter  of  the  earth  : furnished  with  these new  data,
he  resumed  his  calculation  of 1666.  As  he proceeded  therein,
he  saw  that  his early expectations  were  now  likely  to be realized  ;
the  thick  rushing, stupendous  results overpowered  him ; he  be
came  unable  to carry  on  the process  of calculation,  and  intrusted
its completion  to one  of his friends.  The  discoverer  had, indeed,

grasped  the master-fact.  The  law  of falling bodies  at the earth's
surface  was  at length  identified  with  that  which  guided  the moon
in her orbit.  And  so  his GREAT  THOUGHT,  that  had  for sixteen
years loomed  up  in dim,  gigantic  outline, amid  the  first dawn  of a
plausible  hypothesis,  now  stood  forth, radiant  and  not  less grand,
in the mid-day  light  of demonstrated  truth.
   It were  difficult, nay impossible  to imagine,  even,  the  influence

of  a result  like  this upon  a mind  like Newton's.   It was  as  if the
keystone  had  been  fitted  to the glorious  arch by which  his  spirit
should  ascend  to the outskirts  of infinite space —  spanning  the immea
surable — weighing  the imponderable — computing  the  incalculable
—mapping  out  the marchings  of  the planets,  and  the far-wander
ings  of the comefs,  and  catching,  bring back  to earth some  clearer
notes  of  that  higher melody  which,  as  a  sounding  voice,  bears
perpetual  witness  to the design  and  omnipotence  of  a  creating
Deity.
  Newton,  extending  the law  thus  obtained, composed  a  series
of about  twelve  propositions  on  the motion  of the primary  planets

about  the sun.  These  were  sent  to London,  and  communicated
to the Royal  Society  about  the end  of 1683.  At  or near  this pe
riod, other  philosophers,  as  Sir  Christopher  Wren,  Dr.  Halley,
and  Dr. Hooke,  were  engaged  in investigating  the same  subject ;
but  with  no  definite  or  satisfactory  results.  Dr.  Halley,  having

seen,  it is presumed,  our  author's  propositions, went  in August,
1684,  to Cambridge  to  consult  with  him  upon  the  subject.
Newton  assured  him  that he  had  brought  the  demonstration  to
perfection.  In November,  Dr.  Halley  received  a  copy  of  the
work  ; and,  in the following  month^  announced   . it to  the Royal

Society,  with  the  author's  promise  to have  it entered  upon  their
Register.  Newton,  subsequently  reminded  by the Society  of his
promise,  proceeded  in the  diligent preparation  of  the work,  and.
though  suffering  an  interruption  of  six  weeks,  transmitted  the
manuscript  of the  first book  to London  before  the  end  of  April.
The  work  was  entitled  PHILOSOPHI/E  NATURALIS  PRINCIPIA
MATHEMATICA,  dedicated  to  the Royal  Society, and  presented
thereto  on  the 28th  of April, 1685-6.  The  highest encomiums
were  passed  upon  it ; and  the  council  resolved,  on  the  19th  of
May,  to print  it at the expense  of the  Society,  and  under  the  di
rection  of Dr. Halley.  The   latter, a few  days  afterward,  com
municated  these  steps  to Newton,  who,  in a reply, dated  the 20th

of June,  holds  the following  language   :—  " The  proof  you  sent me
I like very  well.  I designed  the whole  to consist  of three  books  ;
the second  was  finished  last summer,  being  short, and  only wants
transcribing,  and  drawing  the cuts fairly.  Some  new  propositions
I have  since thought  on, which  I can  as  well  let alone.  The
third wants  the theory  of comets.  In autumn   last, I spent  two
months  in calculation  to no  purpose  for want  of  a good  method,
which  made  me  afterward  return  to the  first book,  and  enlarge  it

with  diverse  propositions,  some*  relating  to comets,  others  to other
things found  ouf  last winter.  The  third  I now  design  to  sup
press.  Philosophy  is such  an impertinently  litigious lady,  that  a
man  had  as good  be engaged  in l«iw-suits  as have  to do with  her.
I found  it so formerly,  and  now  I can  no  sooner  come  near  her
again, but  she  gives me  warning.  The   first two  books  without
the  third  will  not  so well  bear  the  title  of P/iilosophicc  Naturalis

 Principia  Mathematicia  ; and thereupon  I had  altered  it to  this,
 De  Motu  Corporum  Libri duo.  But  after second  thought  I re
 tain the former  title.  It will help  the  sale  of  the book, which  I

 ought  not  to diminish  now   'tis yours."
   This  " warning"  arose  from  some  pretensions  put  forth by  Dr.
Hooke.  And  though  Newton  gave  a minute  and  positive  refuta
 tions of  such  claims,  yet,  to reconcile  all  differences, he  gener
ously added  to Prop.  IV.  Cor.  6, Book  I, a Scholium,  in which
Wren,  Hooke  and  Halley  are  acknowledged  to have  indepen
dently  deduced  the  law  of  gravity from  the  second  law  of
Kepler.
   The  suppression  of the  third book  Dr. Halley  could  not endure

to see.  " I must  again beg you"  says  he,  " not  to  let your   re
sentments  run  so high  as to deprive  us  of your  third  book, where
in your  applications  of your  mathematical  doctrine  to the theory
of comets,  and  several  curious  experiments,  which,  as I guess by
what  you  write  ought  to compose   it, will undoubtedly  render  it
acceptable  to those who  will  call themselves  philosophers  without

mathematics,  which  are much  the  greater number."  To  these
solicitations Newton  yielded.  There  were  no "resentments,"  how
ever,  as we  conceive,  in  his  " design  to  suppress."  He  sought
peace  ; for he  loved  and  valued  it above  all applause.  But,  in

spite  of his  efforts  for tranquillity's  sake,  his  course  of discovery
was  all along molested  by ignorance  or presumptuous  rivalry.
   The  publication  of the great work  now  went  rapidly  forwards,
The  second  book  was  sent  to the  Society,  and  presented  on  the
2d March  ; the  third,  on  the  6th  April ; and  the whole  was  com
pleted  and  published  in the month  of May,  1686-7.  In the  sec
ond Lemma   of the second  book,  the fundamental  principle  of  his
fiuxionary  calculus  was,  for the  first time, given  to the world  ; but
its algorithm  or  notation  did  not  appear  till published  in  the

second  volume  nf Dr.  Wallis's  works,  in 1693.
   And  thus  was  ushered  into existence  The  PRINCIPIA —  a work
to which  pre-eminence  above  all the  productions  of the  human
intellect  has  been  awarded —  a work  that must  be  esteemed  of
priceless worth  so long  as Science  has  a votary,  or  a single wor
shipper  be  left to kneel  at the  altar  of Truth.

   The  entire work  bears  the general  title of THE  MATHEMATICAL
PRINCIPLES  OF NATURAL  PHILOSOPHY.   It consists  of three books:
the  first two,  entitled, OF  THE MOTION  OF BODIES,  are  occupied
with  the laws  and  conditions  of motions  and  forces, and  are  illus
trated  with many  scholia  treating  of some  of the  most  general
and  best  established  points  in philosophy,  such  as the  density  and
resistance  of  bodies,  spaces  void  of  matter,  and  the motion  of
sound  and  light. From  these  principles,  there  is deduced,  in the
third book, drawn  up  in as popular  a style  as possible  and  entitled,
OF  THE  SYSTEM  OF  THE  WORLD,  the constitution  of the system  of

i he world.  In regard  to this book,  the author  say^ —  " I had, indeed,
composed  the  third Book  in a popular  method,  that  it might  be read
by many  ; but  afterwards,  considering  that such  as had  not  suf-
ficently entered  into  the principles  could  not  easily discover  the

the  areas  to  t\ie times  of their  description,  our  author  inferred
that  the  force which  retained  the  planet  in  its orbit  was  always
directed  to  the  sun  ; and  from  the  second,  namely,  that  every
planet moves  in an  ellipse with  the  sun  in one  of  its foci, he drew
the more  general  inference  that  the  force by which  the  planet
moves  round  that  focus  varies  inversely  as the  square  of  its dis
tance  therefrom  : and  he  demonstrated  that  a planet  acted  upon
by such  a force  could  not move  in any  other  curve  than  a  conic
section  ; showing  when  the moving  body  would  describe  a circu
lar, an  elliptical, a  parabolic,  or hyperbolic  orbit. He  demon
strated,  too, that  this  force, or  attracting,  gravitating  power   re
sided  in every,  the  least  particle ; but  that, in spherical  masses,  it
operated  as  if confined  to their  centres  ; so  that, one  sphere  or
body  will  act upon  another  sphere  or body,  with  a force  directly
proportional  to the  quantity  of matter,  and  inversely  as the square
of the  distance  between  their centres;  and  that  their  velocities  of

mutual  approach  will be  in the  inverse  ratio  of their  quantities  o*'
matter.  Thus  he grandly  outlined  the Universal Law.  Verify
ing  its truth by  the motions  of terrestrial  bodies,  then by  those  of
the moon  and  other  secondary  orbs, he  finally embraced,  in  one
mighty  generalization,  the  entire  Solar  System —  all the  move
ments  of  all its bodies —  planets,  satellites and  comets — explain
ing and harmonizing  the many  diverse  and  theretofore  inexplica
ble phenomena.
  Guided  by the  genius  of Newton,  we  see  sphere  bound   to
sphere, body  to body,  particle  to particle, atom  to mass,  the min
utest  part  to the  stupendous  whole — each  to  each,  each  to  all,
and  all to each —  in the mysterious  bonds  of  a ceaseless,  recipro
cal influence.  An  influence  whose  workings  are  shown  to be

alike present  in the  globular  dew-drop,  or oblate-spheroidal  earth  ;
in the  falling shower,  or  vast heaving  ocean  tides ; in the  flying
thistle-down,  or  fixed, ponderous  rock  ; in the swinging  pendulum,
or  time-measuring  sun  ; in the  varying  and  unequal  moon,  or

earth's  slowly  retrograding  poles ; in the  uncertain  meteor,  or

verging  home,  it may  be, to some  ineffable  centre, where  more
presently  dwells  He  who  inhabiteth  immensity,  and  where   infini
tudes  meet  and  eternities  have  their  condux,  and  where  around
move,  in  softest,  swiftest  measure,  all the  countless  hosts  that

crowd  heaven's  fathomless  deeps.
  And  yet Newton,  amid  the  loveliness  and  magnitude  of Om
nipotence,  lost  not  sight  of the  Almighty  One.  A  secondary,
however  universal,  was  not  taken  for  the  First Cause.  An  im
pressed  force, however  diffused  and  powerful,  assumed  not  the
functions  of  the  creating,  giving Energy.  Material  beauties,
splendours,  and  sublimities, however  rich  in glory, and  endless  in
extent,  concealed  not  the  attributes  of an  intelligent  Supreme.
From  the depths  of his own  soul, through  reason  and  the WORD,
he had  risen,  a priori,  to God  : from  the heights  of Omnipotence,
through  the  design  and  law  of  the builded  universe,  he proved   </

posteriori,  a Deity.  " I had,"  says  he,  " an  eye  upon  such  prin
ciples  as might  work,  with  considering  men,  for  the  belief  of  a

Deity,"  in writing  the PRINCIPIA  ; at the  conclusion  whereof,  he
teaches  that —  " this most  beautiful  system  of the  sun, planets  and
comets,  could  only proceed  from  the counsel  and  dominion  of  an
intelligent  and  powerful  Being.  And   if the  fixed  stars  are  the
centres  of  other  like  systems,  these, being  forme  1 by  the  like
wise  counsels,  must  be  all subject  to the dominion  of One  ; especially
since  the  light  of the  fixed  stars  is of  the same  nature  with  the
light of the  sun,  and  from  every  system  light passes  into  all other
systems  : and  lest the systems  of the  fixed  stars  should,  by their
gravity,  fall on  each  other  mutually,  he hath  placed  those  systems
at immense  distances  one  from  another.

   " This  Being  governs  all things,  not  as the  soul  of  the  world,
but  as Lord  over  all ; and  on  account  of his dominion  he  is wont,
to be called Lord  God  Travrowparwp  or Universal  Ruler  ; for God
is a relative  word,  and  has  a respect  to  servants  ; and  Deity  is
the dominion  of God,  not over  his own  body,  as  those  imagine
who  fancy God  to be  the  soul  of  the  world,  but  over  servants.
The  Supreme  God   is a Being  eternal,  infinite, absolutely  perfect ;
but  a being, however  perfect, without  dominion,  cannot  be  said  to

the God  of Gods,  and  Lord  of Lords  ; but  we  do  not  say, my
Eternal,  your  Eternal,  the Eternal  of Israel, the Eternal  of Gods   :
we  do  not  say my  Infinite,  or my  Perfect  : these  are  titles which
have  no  respect  to  servants.  The  word  God  usually  signifies
Lord  ; but every Lord  is not God.   It is the dominion  of a spir
itual Being  which  constitutes  a God  ; a true, supreme,  or imagi
nary dominion  makes  a true, supreme,  or  imaginary God.  And
from  his true dominion   it follows  that  the  true God  is a  living,
intelligent  and  powerful  Being  ; and  from  his  other  perfections,
that he  is supreme  or  most  perfect.  He   is eternal  and  in
finite, omnipotent  and  omniscient  ; that  is, his  duration  reaches
from  eternity  to  eternity  ; his presence  from  infinity  to infinity ;
he governs  all things  and knows   all things,  that  are  or  can  be
done.  He  is not  eternity  or  infinity, but  eternal  and  infinite  ;
he  is not  duration  and  space,  but  he  endures  and  is present.
He  endures  forever  and  is everywhere  present  ; and  by  existing
always  and  everywhere,  he  constitutes  duration  and space.  Since
every  particle  of space  is always,  and  every  indivisible moment
of duration  is everywhere,  certainly  the Maker  and Lord  of things
cannot  be never  and nowhere.  Every  soul  that  has  perception
is, though  in different  times  and  different  organs  of sense  and mo
tion,  still the same  indivisible person.  There  are  given  succes
sive parts  in duration,  co-existent  parts  in space, but  neither  the
one  nor  the  other  in  the person  of  a man,  or  his  thinking
principle  ; and much  less can  they  be found  in the  thinking  sub
stance  of God.  Every  man.  so  far as he  is a thing  that  has  j:er-
ceptiori,  is one  and  the same  man  during  his whole  life, in  all and
each  of his organs  of sense.  God   is one  and  the same  God,  al
ways  and everywhere.  He  is omnipresent,  not  virtually  only,
but  also substantially ; for  virtue  cannot  subsist  without  sub
stance.  In him  are  all things  contained  and moved  ; yet  neither
affects  the  other  ; God  suffers nothing  from  the motion  of bodies  ;
bodies  find  no  resistance  from  the  omnipresence  of God.   It is
allowed  by  all that  the Supreme  God  exists  necessarily  ; and by
 the same  necessity  he  exists always  and  everywhere.  Whence

only  their  figures and  colours, we  hear  only the  sounds, we  touch
only  their outward  surfaces,  we  smell  only the  smells, and  taste
only the savours  ; but  their inward  substances  are  not  to be known,
either by  our  senses,  or by any  reflex  act  of  our  minds  : much
less, then, have  we  any  idea  of the substance  of God.  We  know
him  only by  his most  wise  and  excellent  contrivances  of  things,
and  final causes  ; we  admire  him  for his perfections  ; but we  rev
erence  and  adore  him  on  account  of his dominion  ; for we  adore
him  as his servants  ; and  a god without  dominion,  providence,  and
final causes,  is nothing  else but  Fate  and  Nature.  Blind  meta
physical  necessity, which  is certainly  the same  always  and  every
where,  could  produce  no  variety  of things.  All  that  diversity  of
natural  things which  we  find suited  to different  times  and  places
could  arise from  nothing  but  the  ideas  and  will  of a Being  neces

sarily existing."
   Thus,  the  diligent  student  of  science,  the  earnest  seeker  of
truth,  led, as through  the  courts  of a sacred  Temple,  wherein,  at
each  step, new  wonders  meet  the  eye,  till, as  a crowning  grace,
they  stand  before  a Holy  of Holies,  and  learn  that  all science  and
all truth  are  one  which  hath  its beginning  and  its end  in  the
knowledge  of Him  whose  glory  the heavens  declare, and  whose
handiwork  the firmament  showeth  forth.
  The  introduction  of the pure  and  lofty doctrines  of the  PRIN-
CIPIA  was  perseveringly  resisted.  Descartes, with  his system  of
vortices,  had sown  plausibly  to  the  imagination,  and  error  had
struck  down  deeply, and  shot up  luxuriantly,  not  only in  the
popular,  but  in the  scientific mind.  Besides  the  idea —  in itself  so
simple  and  so grand —  that  the great  masses  of the  planets  were

suspended  in empty  space,  and  retained  in their  orbits by  an  in
visible  influence  residing  in the  sun — was  to the  ignorant  a thing
inconceivable,  and  to the learned  a revival  of the  occult  qualities
of the  ancient  physics.  This remark  applies  particularly  to the
continent.  Leibnitz  misapprehended  ; Huygens  in part rejected  ;
John  Bernouilli  opposed  ; and  Fontenelle  never  received  the doc
trines  of the PRINCIPIA.  So  that, the saying  of Voltaire  is prob
ably  true,  that though  Newton  survived  the  publication  of  his
great work  more  than  forty  years,  yet,  at the time  of  his  death,
lie had  not above  twenty  followers  out  of England.

   But  in England,  the reception  of  our  author's  philosophy  was
rapid and  triumphant.  His  own  labours,  while  Lucasian  Pro
fessor ; those  of  his  successors  in  that  Chair — Whiston  and
Saunderson  ; those  of Dr.  Samuel  Clarke,  Dr. Laughton,  Roger
Cotes,  and  Dr. Bentley  ; the experimental  lectures  of  Dr.  Keill
and  Desaguliers  ; the  early  and  powerful  exertions  of  David
Gregory  at Edinburgh,  and  of his brother  James  Gregory  at  St.

Andrew's,  tended  to diffuse  widely  in England  and  Scotland  a
knowledge  of, and  taste  for the  truths  of the PRINCIPIA.  Indeed,
its mathematical  doctrines  constituted,  from  the  first, a regular
part  of academical  instruction  ; while  its physical  truths, given  to
the  public  in popular  lectures,  illustrated  by experiments,  had,
before  the  lapse  of twenty  ) ( ar.s, become  familiar  to, and adopted

by the general mind.  Pemberton's  popular  " View  of Sir  Isaac
Newton's  Philosophy"  was  published,  in 1728  ; and  the year  after
ward,  an English  translation  of the PRINCIPIA,  and System  of the
World,  by Andrew  Motte.  And  since  that period,  the labours  of
Le  Seur  and  Jacquier,  of Thorpe,  of Jebb,  of Wright  and  others
have  greatly  contributed  to display  the most  hidden  treasures  of
the PRINCIPIA.
  About  the time  of the publication  of the  Principia, James   II.,
bent  on  re-establishing  the Romish  Faith,  had, among  other   ille
gal acts, ordered  by mandamus,  the  University  of Cambridge  to
confer  the degree  of Master  of Arts  upon  an  ignorant  monk.
Obedience  to  this mandate  was  resolutely  refused.  Newton  was
one  of the  nine  delegates  chosen  to defend  the independence  of
the University.  They  appeared  before  the High  Court  ;— and

successfully  : the  king  abandoned  his design.  The  prominent
part which  our  author  took  in these proceedings,  and  his eminence
in the  scientific  world,  induced  his proposal  as one  of the  parlia
mentary  representatives  of  the University.  He  was  elected,  in
1688,  and  sat  in the Convention  Parliament   till its  dissolution.
After  the  first year, however,  he seems  to have  given  little or  no
attention  to his parliamentary  duties, being  seldom  absent  from
the University   till his appointment  in the Mint,  in 1695.
  Newton  began  his theological  researches  sometime  previous  to
1691  ; in the prime  of his years, and  in the matured  vigour  of
his intellectual powers.  From  his  youth,  as we  have  seen, he
had  devoted  himself  with  an  activity  the most  unceasing,  and  an
energy  almost  superhuman  to the discovery  of physical  truth  ;—
giving  to Philosophy  a new  foundation,  and  to  Science  a  new
temple.  To  pass  on, then, from  the consideration  of the material,
more  directly  to that  of  the  spiritual, was  a natural,  nay,  with  so
large and  devout  a soul,  a necessary  advance.  The  Bible  was  to
him  of inestimable  worth.  In  the  elastic freedom,  which  a pure
and unswerving  faith  in Him  of Nazareth  gives,  his mighty  facul
ties enjoyed  the  only completest  scope  for development.  His
original endowment,  however  great, combined  with  a  studious
application, however  profound,  would  never,  without  this  libera
tion from  the dominion  of passion  and  sense, have  enabled  him  to
attain  to that wondrous  concentration  and  grasp  of  intellect,  for
which  Fame  has  as  yet  assigned  him  no  equal.  Gratefully  he
owned,  therefore,  the'same  Author  in the Book  of Nature  and  the
Book  of Revelation.  These  were  to him  as drops  of  the same
unfathomable  ocean  ;—  as outrayings  of the same  inner  splendour  ;
—  as tones  of the same  ineffable  voice  ;—  as segments  of the same

infinite curve.  "With  great  joy he had  found  himself  enabled  to
proclaim,  as an  interpreter,  from  the hieroglyphs  of Creation,  the
existence  of a God  : and  now,  with  greater  joy, and  in the  fulness
of his knowledge,  and  in the  fulness  of  his  strength,  he laboured
to make  clear, from  the utterances  of the inspired Word,  the  far
mightier  confirmations  of a Supreme  Good,  in  all  its glorious
amplitude  of Being  and  of Attribute  ; and  to bring  the  infallible
workings  thereof  plainly home  to  the  understandings  and  the

| Newton began | his theological r | esearches s | ometime | previous to |
| 1691 ; i n the pr | ime of his years, a | nd in the | matured | vigour of |
| his intellectual p | owers. From hi | s youth, as | we hav | e seen, he |
| had devoted him | self with an activi | ty the most | unceasi | ng, and an |

consists  of two  parts  : the  one  devoted  to  the  Prophecies  oi
Daniel,  and  the  other  to the Apocalypse  of St. John.  In the  first

Testament  ;—  of the prophetic  language  ;— of the  vision  of  the
four  beasts  ;— of  the kingdoms  represented  by the  feet  of  the
image  composed  of iron and  clay ;— of the  ten  kingdoms  repre
sented  by  the  ten horns  of the  beast  ;— of the  eleventh  horn  of
Daniel's  fourth  beast  ; of  the power  which  should  change  times
and  laws ;— of the  kingdoms  represented  in Daniel  by  the ram
and  he-goat  ;—  of the  prophecy  of the  seventy  weeks  ;—  of the
times  of the birth  and  passion  of Christ  ;—  of the prophecy  of the

and  regarded  not  the  desire  of women  ;— of  the Mahuzzim,  hon
oured  by  the king who  doeth  according  to  his will.  In the  sec
ond  part, he  treats  of the  time when  the Apocalypse  was  written    ,
of the  scene  of the  vision, and  the  relation  which  the Apocalypse
has  to the book  of the law  of Moses,  and  to the worship  of God
in the temple  ;—  of the  relation  which  the Apocalypse  has  to the
prophecies  of Daniel,  and  of the  subject  of  the prophecy  itself
Newton  regards  the prophecies  as given,  not  for the  gratification

of man's  curiosity, by enabling  him  to foreknow  ; but  for his con
viction  that  the world  is governed  by Providence,  by witnessing
their  fulfilment.  Enough  of prophecy,  he  thinks, has  already
been  fulfilled  to  afford  the  diligent  seeker  abundant  evidence  of

God's  providence.  The  whole  work  is marked  by  profound
erudition,  sagacity  and  argument.
   And  not  less learning,  penetration  and  masterly  reasoning  are
conspicuous  in  his HISTORICAL  ACCOUNT  OF Two  NOTABLE

Treatise,  first accurately  published  in Dr.  Horsley's  edition  of his
works,  relates  to two  texts  : the  one,  1 Epistle  of  St. John  v. 7 ;
the  other,  1 Epistle  of  St. Paul  to Timothy   iii. 16.  As  this
work  had  the  effect  to deprive  the  advocates  of the  doctrine  of
the Trinity  of two  leading  texts, Newton  has  been  looked  upon
as an Arian  ; but  there  is absolutely  nothing  in  his  writings  to
warrant  such  a conclusion.

   His  regaining  theological  works  consist  of  the LEXICON  PRO-
PHETICUM,  which  was  left incomplete  ; a  Latin  Dissertation  on
the sacred  cubit  of the Jews,  which  was  translated  into  English,
and  published,  in 1737.  among  the Miscellaneous  Works   of John
Greaves  ; and FOUR  LETTERS  addressed  to Dr.  Bentlty,  contain
ing some  arguments  in proof  of a Deity.  These  Letters  were
dated  respectively  : 10th December,  1692  ; 17th  January,  1693  ;
25th  February,  1693;  and  llth  February,  1693— the  fourth
bearing  an  earlier  date  than  the  third.  The  best  faculties  and
the  profoundest  acquirements  of  our  author  are  convincingly
manifest  in these  lucid  and  powerful  compositions.  They  were
published  in 1756,  and  reviewed  by Dr. Samuel  Johnson.

   Newton's  religious  writings  are distinguished  by  their  absolute
freedom  from  prejudice.  Everywhere,  throughout  them,  there
glows  the genuine  nobleness  of soul.  To  his whole   life, indeed,
we  may  here  fitly extend  the  same  observation.  He  was  most
richly imbued  with  the very  spirit of the  Scriptures  which  he  so
delighted  to study  and  to meditate  upon.  His  was  a  piety,  so
fervent,  so  sincere  and  practical,  that  it rose up like  a holy incense
from  every  thought  and act.  His  a benevolence  that  not  only
willed, but  endeavoured  the  best  for  all.  His  a philanthropy
that  held  in  the  embracings  of  its love  every  brother-man.
His  a toleration  of  the  largest  and  the  truest  ; condemning  per
secution  in every,  even  its mildest  form  ; and  kindly encouraging
each  striving  after  excellence   :—  .1 toleration  that came  not  of
indifference —  for the  immoral  and  the  impious  met  with  their
quick  rebuke — but  a toleration  that came  of the  wise humbleness
and  the  Christian  charity, which  see, in the  nothingness  of  self
and  the  almightiness  of TRUTH,  no  praise  for  the  ablest, and  no
blame  for th^  feeblest  in their strugglings upward  to light and  life.

    Tn the winter  of 1691-2,  on  returning  from  chapel,  one  morn
 ing, Newton  foima  tnat  a favourite  little dog, called  Diamond,
 had  overturned  a lighted  taper  on  his  desk, and  that  several  pa
 pers  containing  the  results  of  certain  optical  experiments,  were
nearly consumed.  His  only exclamation,  on  perceiving  his  loss,
was,  " Oh  Diamond,  Diamond,  little knowest  thou  the  mischiel
 thou  hast done,"  Dr.  Brewster,  in his  life of our  author,  gives  the
following  extract  from  the manuscript  Diary  of Mr. Abraham  De
La  Pryme.  a student  in the  University  at  the time  of  this  oc
currence.

    " 1692.  February,  3. — What  I heard  to-day  I must  relate.
There   is one  Mr. Newton  (whom  I have  very  oft  seen), Fellow
of Trinity  College,  that  is mighty  famous  for  his learning,  being  a
most  excellent  mathematician,  philosopher,  divine, &c.  He  has
been  Fellow  of the Royal  Society  these many  years  ; and among

other  very learned  books  and  tracts,  he:s written  one  upon  the mathe
matical  principles  of philosophy,  which  has given  him  a mighty
name,  he having  received,  especially  from  Scotland,  abundance  of
congratulatory  letters  for the same  ; but  of  all the books  he  ever
wrote,  there  was  one  of colours  and  light, established  upon  thou
sands  of experiments  which  he had  been  twenty  years  of making,
and  which  had  cost him many  hundreds  of pounds.  This  book
which  he vaiued  so much,  and  which  was  so much  talked  of, had
the  ill luck  to perish, and  be  utterly  lost just when  the  learned
author  was  almost  at pitting  a conclusion  at the same,  after  this

manner  : In  a winter's  morning,  leaving  it among  his other  papers
on  his study  table  while  he went  to chapel,  the  candle, which  he
had  unfortunately  left burning  there,  too, catched  hold  by some
means  of other  papers,  and  they  fired the  aforesaid  book,  and  ut
terly consumed   it and  several  other  valuable  writings  ; arid which
is most  wonderful  did no  further  mischief.  But  when  Mr. New
ton came  from  chapel, and  had  seen  what  was  done,  every  one
thought  he would  have  run  mad,  he was  so troubled  thereat  that
he was  not  himself  for  a month  after.  A  long account  of this  his
system  of colours  you may  find  in the Transactions  of the Royal
Society,  which  he had  sent  up  to them  long before  this  sad  mis

chance  happened  unto  him."

                          LIFE    OF    SIR   ISAAC NEWTON.     43


   It will be borne  in mind  that  all of Newton's  theological  wri
tings, with  the exception  of the  Letters  to Dr.  Bentley,  were
composed  before  this  event  which,  we  must  conclude,  from

Pryme's  words, produced  a serious  impression  upon  our  author  for
about  a month.  But  M.  Biot,  in his Life  of Newton,  relying  on  a
memorandum  contained  in a small manuscript  Journal  of Huygens,
declares  this occurrence  to have  caused  a deran-gement  of New

ton's  intellect.  M.  Blot's  opinions  and  deductions,  however,   as
well  as those  of La  Place,  upon  this  subject, were  based  upon
erroneous  data, and  have  been  overthrown  by  the  clearest  proof.

There   is not,  in fact, the  least evidence  that Newton's  reason  was,
for  a single moment,  dethroned  ; on  the  contrary,  the testimony
is conclusive  that  he was,  at  all times,  perfectly  capable  of carry
ing on  his mathematical,  metaphysical  and  astronomical  inquiries.
Loss  of sleep,  loss  of appetite, and  irritated  nerves  will  disturb
somewhat  the equanimity  of the most  serene  ; and  an  act done,  or
language  employed,  under  such  temporary  discomposure,   is not  a

just criterion  of the general  tone and  strength  of  a  man's  mind.
As  to the accident  itself, we  may  suppose,  whatever  might  have
been  its precise  nature,  that  it greatly  distressed  him,  and,  still
further,  that  its shock  may  have  originated  the  train  of nervous
derangements,  which  afflicted  him, more  or  less, for two  years
afterward.  Yet,  during  this very  period  of  ill health, we  find him
putting  forth  his highest powers.  In  1692,  he prepared  for, and
transmitted  to Dr.  Wallis  the  first proposition  of  the  Treatise  on
Quadratures,  with  examples  of  it in  first, second  and  third  flux
ions.  He  investigated,  in the same  year, the  subject  of  haloes  ;
making  and  recording  numerous  and  important  observations  rela
tive thereto.  Those  profound  and  beautiful  Letters  to Dr. Bentley
were  written  at the  close  of this and  the  beginning  of  the  next
year.  In October,  1693,  Locke,  who  was  then  about  publishing  a
second  edition  of his work  on  the Human  Understanding,  request
ed Newton   to reconsider  his opinions  on  innate  ideas.  And   in
 1694,  he was  zealously  occupied  in perfecting  his lunar  theory  ;
visiting Flamstead,  at the Royal  Observatory  of Greenwich,  in
September,  and  obtaining  a  series  of lunar  observations  ; and

 commencing,   in October,  a correspondence  with  that  distinguished
 practical Astronomer,  which  continued   till 1698.
  We  now  arrive  at the period when  Newton  permanently  with
drew  from  the  seclusion  of  a collegiate,  and  entered  upon  a more
active  and  public  life. He  was  appointed Warden  of the  Mint,
 in 1695,  through  the  influence  of Charles  Montague,  Chancellor
 of the Exchequer,  and  afterward  Earl  of Halifax.  The  current
roin  of the  nation  had  been  adulterated  and  debased,  and  Mon

tague  undertook  a re-coinage.  Our  author's  mathematical  and
chemical  knowledge  proved  eminently  useful  in accomplishing
this  difficult and  most  salutary reform.  In  1699, he  was  pro
moted  to the Mastership  of the Mint —  an  office worth  twelve  or
fifteen hundred  pounds  per annum,  and  which  he  held  during  the
remainder  of his life. He  wrote,  in this capacity,  an  official Re
port  on  the Coinage,  which  has been  published ; he  also prepared
a Table  of Assays  of Foreign  Coins, which  was  printed  at the
end  of Dr. Arbuthnot's  Tables  of Ancient  Coins,  Weights,  and
Measures,  in 1727.
  Newton  retained  his  Professorship  at Cambridge   till 1703.
But  he  had,  on  receiving  the appointment  of Master  of the Mint,
in 1699, made  Mr.  Whiston  his deputy,  with  all the emoluments
of the  office  ; and, on  finally resigning,  procured  his nomination  to
the vacant  Chair.
   In January  1697,  John  Bernouilli  proposed  to the most  distin
guished  mathematicians  of Europe  two  problems  for  solution.
Leibnitz,  admiring  the beauty  of one  of them,  requested  the time
for solving  it to be extended  to twelve  months — twice  the period
originally named.  The  delay was  readily granted.  Newton,  how
ever,  sent  in, the day  after  he received  the problems,  a solution  of
them  to the President  of the Royal  Society.  Bernouilli  obtained

solutions  from  Newton,  Leibinitz  and  the Marquis  De  L'Hopital  ;
but  Newton's  though  anonymous,  he  immediately  recognised
" tanquam  ungue  leonem"  as  the  lion  is known  by  his  claw.
We  may  mention  here  the  famous  problem  of the  trajectories

proposed  by Leibnitz,  in 1716,  for the  purpose  of  "feeling  the
pulse  of the English  Analysts."  Newton  received  the  problem
about  five o'clock  in the  afternoon,  as he was  returning  from  the

fatigued,  yet he completed   its solution,  the  same  evening  before
he went  to bed.

   The  history  of these problems  affords, by  direct  comparison,   a

striking  illustration  of Newton's  vast  superiority  of mind.  That
amazing  concentration  and  grasp  of  intellect,  of which  we  have
spoken,  enabled  him  to master  speedily,  and, as  it were,  by  a
single  effort, those  things,  for the achievement  of which,  the many
would  essay  utterly  in vain, and  the  very,  very few  attain  only
after long  and  renewed  striving. And  yet, with  a modesty   as
unparalleled  as his power,  he  attributed  his successes,  not  to any
extraordinary  sagacity,  but  solely  to industry  and  patient thought.
Mr- kept  the  subject  of consideration  constantly  before  him,  and
waited  till the  first dawning  opened  gradually  into  a  full and
clear  light ; never  quitting,  if possible,  the mental  process  till the
object  of  it were  wholly  gained.  He  never  allowed  this habit  of
meditation  to appear  in his intercourse  with  society ; but  in  the
privacy  of his own  chamber,  or  in the  midst  of his own  family, he
gave  himself  up  to the deepest  abstraction.  Occupied  with some
interesting  investigation,  he  would  often  sit down  on  his bedside,
after  he  rose, and  remain  there,  for  hours,  partially  dressed.
Meal-time  would  frequently come  and  pass  unheeded  ; so  that,
unless  urgently  reminded,  he would  neglect  to  take  the  re
quisite quantity  of nourishment.  But  notwithstanding  his anx
iety to be  left undisturbed,  he  would, when  occasion  required,
turn  aside  his thoughts,  though  bent  upon  the  most  intricate  re
search,  and  then, when  leisure  served,  again  direct them  to  the
very  point where  they  ceased  to  act  : and  this he seemed  to  ac
complish  not  so much  by the  force  of his memory,   as by the force
of his inventive  faculty, before  the vigorous  intensity  of which,  no
subject, however  abstruse,  remained  long unexplored.
  Me  was  elected  a member  of  the Royal Academy  of  Sciences
at Paris,  in 1699, when  that distinguished  Body  were  empowered,
by  a new  charter,  to admit  a small  number  of foreign  associates.
In 1700,  he communicated  to Dr. Halley  a description  of  his  re

flecting instrument  for observing  the  moon's  distance  from  the
fixed stars.  This  description  was  published  in the  Philosophical

Transactions,  in 1742.  The  instrument  was  the  same  as  that
produced  by Mr.  Hadley,  in 1731,  and  which,  under  the name  of

Hadley's  Quadrant,  has been  of  so  great  use  in navigation.  On
the assembling  of the new  Parliament,  in 1701, Newton  was   re-
elected  one  of the members   for the University  of Cambridge.  In
1703,  he was  chosen  President  of the Royal  Society  of London,
to which  office he was  annually  re-elected  till the  period  of  his
decease — about  twenty-five  years  afterward.
  Our  author  unquestionably  devoted  more  labour  to, and,  in
many  respects,  took  a greater  pride  in his Optical,  than  his other
discoveries.  This  science  he  had  placed  on  a new  and  indestruc
tible  basis  ; and  he wished  not  only  to build, but  to  perfect  the
costly  and glowing  structure.  He  had communicated,  before  the
publication  of the PRINCIPIA,  his most  important  researches  on
light to the Royal  Society,  in detached  papers  which  were  inserted
in successive  numbers  of the  Transactions  ; but  he  did  not pub
lish  a connected  view  of these  labours  till 1704, when  they appeared
under  the  title of OPTICS   : OR,  A TREATISE  ON THE  REFLEXIONS,
REFRACTIONS,  INFLEXIONS  AND  COLOURS  OF LIGHT.  To   this,
but  to  no subsequent  edition, were  added  two  Mathematical  Trea
tises, entitled, TRACTATUS  DUO  DE  SPECIEBUS  ET MAGNITUDINE
FIGURARUM  cuRViLiNEARUM  ; the one  bearing  the  title TRACTATUS
DE QUADRATURA  CuRVARUM  ; and  the  other,  that  of ENUMERATIO
LINEARUM  TERTII  ORDiNis.  The  publication  of these Mathemati
cal Treatises  was  made  necessary  in consequence  of plagiarisms
from  the manuscripts  of them  loaned  by the author  to his friends.
Dr. Samuel  Clarke  published  a Latin  translation  of the  Optics,  in
in 1706  ; whereupon  he was  presented  by Newton,  as  a mark  of
his grateful  approbation,  with  five hundred  pounds,  or one  hun
dred  pounds  for each  of his children.  The  work  was  afterward
translated  into French.  It had  a remarkably  wide  circulation,
and  appeared,  in several  successive  editions, both  in England  and
on  the Continent.  There  is displayed,  particularly  on  this Opti

cal Treatise,  the  author's  talent  for simplifying  and  communica
ting the profoundest  speculations.  It is a faculty  rarely  united  to
that  of the highest invention.  Newton  possessed  both  ; and  thus
that mental  perfectness  which  enabled  him  to  create,  to combine,

but inconceivably  more,  the pre-eminent  benefactor  of his species.
  The  honour  of knighthood  v/as  conferred  on  our  author  in
1705.  Soon  afterward,  he was  a candidate  again  for the Repre
sentation  of the University,  but was  defeated  by a large majority.
It is thought  that  a more  pliant man  was  preferred  by both  min
isters and electors.  Newton  was  always  remarkable  for simplicity
of  dress, and  his  only known  departure  from  it was  on  this  oc
casion, when  he  is said  to have  appeared  in  a  suit  of  laced
clothes.
  The  Algebraical  Lectures  which  he  had, Juring  nine  years,
delivered  at Cambridge,  were  published  by Whiston,  in  1707,
under  the  title of ARITHMETICS  UNIVERSALIS,  SINE  DE  COMPOSI
TIONS  ET RESOLUTIONS  ARITHMETICA  LIBER.  This  publication

is said  to have  been  a breach  of confidence  on Whiston's  part.  Mr.
Ralphson,  not long afterward,  translated  the work  into  English ;
and  a second  edition  of  it, with  improvements  by the  author,  was
issued  at London,  1712,  by Dr. Machin.  Subsequent  editions,
both  in English  and  Latin,  with commentaries,  have  been  published.
   In  June, 1709, Newton  intrusted  the  superintendence  of  a
second  edition  of the  PRINCIPIA  to Roger  Cotes, Plumian  Pro
fessor  of Astronomy  at Cambridge.  The   first edition  had  been
sold  off for some  time.  Copies  of the work  had  become  very
rare, and  could  only be  obtained  at  several  times  their  original
cost.  A  great number  of  letters passed  oetween  the author  and
Mr.  Cotes  during  the  preparation  of the  edition, which  finally
appeared  in May,  1713.  It had  many  alterations  and  improve
ments,  and  was  accompanied  by an  admirable  Preface  from  the
pen  of Cotes.

   Our  author's  early Treatise,  entitled, ANALYSIS  PER EQUATIONES
NUMERO  TERMINORUM  INFINITAS,  as well  as  a small  Tract,  Gearing
the  title of METHODUS  DIFFERENTIALS,  was  published,  witn   nis

consent,  in 1711.  The'  former  of  these,  and  the  Treatise  De
Quadratura  Curvarum,  translated  into Englisn,  witn  a .arge com

48             LIFE    OF    SIR   ISAAC   NEWTON.


   It is a notable  fact, in Newton's  history,  that  he  never  volun*
tarily published  any  one  of  his purely  mathematical  writings
The  cause  of  this unwillingness  in some,  and, in other  instances,
of his indifference,  or,  at least, want  of  solicitude  to put  forth  his
works  may  be confidently  sought  for  in his repugnance  to every
thing  like contest  or dispute.  But, going  deeper  than  this aver
sion, we  find, underlying  his whole  character  and  running  parallel
with  all his discoveries,  that extraordinary  humility  which  always
preserved  him  in a position  so  relatively  just to  the  behests  of
time  and  eternity,  that  the  infinite value  of truth, and  the  utter
worthlessness  of  fame, were  alike  constantly  present  to  him.
Judging  of his course,  however,  in  its more  temporary  aspect,  as
bearing  upon  his immediate  quiet,  it seemed  the most  unfortunate.
For  an  early publication,  especially  in the  case  of his Method  of
Fluxions,  would  have  anticipated  all rivalry, and  secured  him
from  the contentious  claims  of Leibnitz.   Still each  one  will solve
the problem  of his existence  in his own  way,  and, with  a manlike
Newton,  his own,  as we  conceive,  could  be  no  other  than  the best
way.  The  conduct  of Leibnitz  in this  affair  is quite irreconcilable
with  the  stature  and  strength  of the  man  ; giant-like,  and  doing

nobly,  in many  ways,  a giant's work,  yet cringing  himself  into the
dimensions  and performances  of  a common  calumniator.  Opening
in 1699,  the  discussion  in question  continued   till the  close  of

Leibnitz's  life, in 1716.  We  give the summary  of the  case  as
contained  in the Report  of the Committee   of the Royal  Society,
the  deliberately  weighed  opinion  of which  has been  adopted  as an
authoritative  decision  in  all countries.

    " We  have  consulted  the  letters and  letter books  in the custody
 of the Royal  Society,  and  those  found  among  the  papers  of Mr.
John  Collins,  dated  between  the years 1669  and  1677,  inclusive   ;
and showed  them  to such  as knew  and avouched  the hands  of Mr.
Barrow,  Mr.  Collins,  Mr.  Oldenburg,  and  Mr.  Leibnitz  ; and
compared  those  of Mr. Gregory  with  one  another,  and  with  copies
 of some  of them  taken  in the  hand  of Mr.  Collins  ; and  have
 extracted  from  them  what  relates  to  the  matter  referred  to  us  :

kept  a correspondence  with  Mr.  Collins, by means  of Mr. Olden
burg,  till about  September,  1676,  and  then  returned, by London
and Amsterdam,  to Hanover:  and  that Mr.  Collins  was  very  free
in communicating  to able mathematicians  what  he  had  received
from  Mr, Newton  and  Mr.  Gregory.
   " II. That  when  Mr.  Leibnitz  was  the  first time  in London,
he contended  for  the  invention  of another  differential  method,
properly  so  called  ; and, notwithstanding  he was  shown  by Dr.

Pell  that  it was  Newton?s  method,  persisted  in maintaining  it to
be  his own  invention,  by reason  that  he had  found  it by himself
without  knowing  what Newton  had  done  before,  and  had  much
improved  it. And  we  find  no  mention  of  his having  any  other
differential method  than Newton's  before  his  letter  of the 21st  of
June,  1677,  which  was  a year  after  a copy  of Mr. Newton's  letter
of the  10th  of December,  1672,  had  been  sent  to Paris  to be
communicated   to him  ; and above  four  years  after Mr.  Collins
began  to communicate  that  letter  to his correspondents  ; in which
letter  the method  of  fluxions  was  sufficiently  described  to  any
intelligent  person.

   "III.  That  by Mr.  Newton's  letter,  of the  13th  of June, 1676
it appears  that  he had  the method  of  fluxions  above  five  years
before  the  writing  of that letter.  And  by  his Analysis  per ^Equa-
tiones numero  Terminorum   Infmitas, communicated  by Dr. Barrow
to Mr.  Collins,  in July, 1669,  we  find that  he  had  invented  the
method  before  that  time.

   "IV.  That  the  differential method  is one  and  the  same  with
the method  of fluxions, excepting  the name  and mode  of notation  ;
Mr.  Leibnitz  calling those  quantities  differences  which  Mr. Newton
calls moments,  or fluxions  ; and marking  them  with  a letter d —  a
mark  not  used  by Mr.  Newton.

   " And,  therefore,  we  take  the proper  question  to  be, not who
invented  this or  that method,  but, who  was  the  first inventor  of
the method ?  And  we  believe  that  those who  have  reputed  Mr.
Leibnitz  the  first inventor  knew   little  or nothing  of his correspond
ence  with Mr.  Collins  and  Mr.  Oldenburg  long before,  nor  of Mr.

publication  seemed  to infuse  additional  bitterness  into  the feelings
of  Leibnitz, who  descended  to  unfounded  charges  and  empty
threats.  He  had  been  privy  counsellor  to  the  Elector  of Han

in his correspondence,  in 1715  and  1716,  with  the Abbe  Conti,
then  at the  court  of George  L, and  with  Caroline,  Princess  of
Wales,  he attacked  the  doctrines  of the PRINCIPIA,  and  indirectly
 its author,  in a manner  very  discreditable  to  himself,  both  as  a
learned  and  as an honourable  man.  His  assaults, however,  were
triumphantly  met;  and,  to the complete  overthrow  of  his  rival
 pretensions, Newton  was  induced  to give the finishing blow.  The
 verdict  is universal  and  irreversible  that  the  English  preceded
 the German  philosopher,  by  at least  ten  years,  in the invention
 of fluxions.  Newton  could  not  have  borrowed  from  Leibnitz  ;
 but Leibnitz  might  have  borrowed  from Newton.  A new  edition

basis.

  A  petition  to have  inventions  for promoting  the discovery  of the
longitude  at sea, suitably  rewarded,  was  presented  to the House
of Commons,  in 1714.  A  committee,  having  been  appointed  to
investigate  the  subject,  called upon Newton  and  others  for  their
opinions.  That  of our  author  was  given  in writing,  A  report,
favourable  to the  desired  measure,  was  then  taken  up, and  a  bill
for  its adoption  subsequently  passed.
  On  the  ascension  of George  I., in 1714, Newton  became   an
object  of profound  interest  at court.  His  position  under  govern
ment,  his surpassing  fame,  his spotless  character,  and.  above   all,
his deep  and  consistent  piety,  attracted  the reverent  regard  of the
Princess  of Wales,  afterward  queen -consort  to George  II.  She
was  a woman   of a highly  cultivated  mind,  and  derived  the greatest
pleasure  from  conversing  with Newton  and  corresponding  with
Leibnitz.  One  day,  in conversation  with  her, our  author  men
tioned  and  explained  a new  system  of chronology,  which  he had

composed  at Cambridge,  where  he  had  been  in the  habit  " of
refreshing  himself  with  history  and  chronology,  when  he  wac

weary  with  other  studies."  Subsequently,  in the year  1718,  she
requested  a copy  of this interesting  and ingenious work  Newton,
accordingly,  drew  up  an  abstract  of the system  from  the separate
papers  in which   it existed,  and  gave  it to her  on  condition  that  it
should  riot be  communicated  to any  other  person.  Sometime
afterward  she requested  that  the Abbe  Conti  might  be  allowed
to have  a copy  of it  The  author  consented:  and  the  abbe
received  a copy  of the manuscript,  under  the  like injunction  and

promise  of secrecy.  This  manuscript  bore  the  title of  " A  short
Chronicle,  from  the First Memory  of Tilings  in Europe,  to the

Conquest  of Persia, by Alexander  the  Great."
   After Newton  took  up  his residence  in London,  he  lived  in  a
style suited  to his elevated  position and  rank.  He  kept  his  car
riage, with  an  establishment  of three  male  and  three  female  serv
ants.  But  to everything  like vain show  and luxury  he was  utterly
averse.  His  household  affairs, for  the  last twenty  years  of  his
life, were  under  the charge  of  his  niece, Mrs.  Catherine  Barton,

wife  and widow  of Colonel  Barton —  a woman   of great beauty  and
accomplishment —  and subsequently  married  to John  Conduit,  Esq.
At home  Newton  was  distinguished  by  that  dignified  and  gentle
hospitality  which  springs  alone  from  true nobleness.  On  all pro
per  occasions,  he gave  splendid  entertainments,  though  without
ostentation.  In  society, whether  of the  palace  or  the  cottage,
his manner  was  self-possessed  and  urbane  ; his look  benign  and
affable ; his speech  candid  and  modest  ; his whole  air undisturb
edly serene.  He  had  none  of what  are  usually  called  the singu
larities  of genius  ; suiting  himself  easily  to  every  company —
except  that  of the vicious  and wicked  ; and  speaking  of himself
and  others,  naturally,  so  as never  even  to be suspected  of vanity.
There  was  in him,  if we  may  be allowed  the expression,  a WHOLE
NESS  of  nature,  which  did not  admit  of such  imperfections  and
weakness —  the  circle was  too  perfect,  the  law  too  constant,  and
the disturbing  forces  too  slight  to  suffer  scarcely  any  of  those
eccentricities  which  so interrupt  and  mar  the movements   of many
bright  spirits, rendering  their  course  through  the world  more  like
that  of the blazing  meteor  than  that  of  the  light and  life-impart
ing sun.  In  brief, the words  GREATNESS  and  GOODNESS  could
not, humanly  speaking,  be more  fitly employed  than when  applied
as the pre-eminent  characteristics  of  this  pure, meek  and  vene
rable  sage.
   In  the  eightieth  year  of  his age, Newton  was  seized  with
symptoms   of stone  in the bladder.  His  disease  was  pronounced
incurable.  He  succeeded,  however,  by means  of  a strict regimen,
and  other  precautions,  in alleviating  his complaint,  and  procuring
long  intervals  of ease.  His  diet, always  frugai, was  now  extremely
temperate,  consisting  chiefly  of broth,  vegetables,  and  fruit, with,
now  and  then,  a little butcher  meat.  He  gave  up  the use  of  his
carriage,  and  employed,  in its stead, when  he went  out,  a  chair.
All  invitations  to dinner  were  declined  ; and  only  small  parties
were  received,  occasionally,  at his own  house.
   In 1724  he wrote  to the Lord  Provost  of Edinburgh,  offering
to  contribute  twenty  pounds  yearly  toward  the  salary  of Mr.
Maclaurin,  provided  he  accepted  the  assistant  Professorship  of
Mathematics   in the  University  of that place.  Not  only  in  the

Those,  he would  often  remark,  who  gave  away  nothing  till they
died, never  gave  at all.  His  wealth  had become  considerable  by
a prudent  economy  ; but he  regarded  money  in no  other  light
than  as one  of  the means  wherewith  he had  been  intrusted  to do

good,  and  he  faithfully employed   it accordingly.
  He  experienced,  in spite  of  all his precautionary  measures,   a
return  of his complaint  in the month  of August,  of the same  year,
1 724, when  he passed  a stone  the  size  of pea  ; it came  from  him
in two  pieces,  the  one  at the  distance  of two  day.s from  the  other.
Tolerable  good  health  then  followed  for some  months.   In Janu
ary, 1725,  however,  he  was  taken  with  a violent cough  and  inflam
mation  of the lungs.  In consequence  of  this attack,  he was  pre
vailed  upon  to remove  to Kensington,  where  his health  greatly
improved.  In February  following,  he was  attacked  in both  feet
with  the  gout,  of the approach  of which  he had  received,  a few
years  before,  a slight warning,  and  the  presence  of which  now
produced   a very  beneficial  change  in  his general  health.  Mr.
Conduit,  his nephew,  has  recorded  a curious  conversation  which
took  place,  at  or  near  this time, between  himself  and  Sir  Isaac.

   "I  was,  on Sunday  night,  the  7th March,  1724-5,  at Kensing
ton, with  Sir Isaac Newton,  in his lodgings,  just after he was  out
of a  fit of the  gout, which  he had  had  in both  of his  feet, for  the
first time,  in the  eighty-third  year  of his age.  He  was  better  after
it, and  his head  clearer  and memory  stronger  than  I had known
them  for some  time.  He  then  repeated  to me, by way  of  dis
course,  very  distinctly, though  rather  in answer  to my  queries,
than  in one  continued  narration,  what  he had  often  hinted  to me
before,  viz. : that  it was  his conjecture  (he would  affirm nothing)
that  there  was  a sort  of revolution  in the  heavenly  bodies  ; that
the vapours  and  light, emitted  by  the  sun, which  had  their  sedi
ment,  as water  and  other  matter,  had  gathered  themselves,  by
degrees,  into  a body,  and  attracted  more  matter  from  the  planets,
and  at last made   a secondary  planet  (viz. : one  of those  that  go
round  another  planet), and  then,  by  gathering  to  them,  and

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| "I was, o | n Sunday | night | , the 7th M | ar | ch, 1724- | 5, at | Kensing |

attracting more  matter, became   a primary  planet ; and  then, bf
increasing  still, became   a comet,  which,  after  certain  revolutions,
by coming  nearer  and  nearer  to the  sun, had  all its volatile  parts
condensed,  and  became   a matter   tit to  recruit  and  replenish  the
sun (which  must  waste  by the  constant  heat  and  light  it emitted),
as  a faggot would  this  fire  if put  into  it (we  were  sitting by  a
wood  fire), and  that  that would  probably  be  the  effect  of the
comet  of 1680,  sooner  or  later ; for, by  the  observations  made
upon  it, it appeared,  before  it came  near  the  sun,  with  a tail only
two  or three  degrees  long ; but, by the heat  it contracted,  in going
so  near  the  sun,  it seemed  to have  a tail of thirty  or forty degrees
when   it went  frpm  it ; that  he  could  not  say when  this comet
would  drop  into  the  sun ; it might  perhaps  have  five  or  six revo
lutions more   first, but whenever   it did  it would  so much  increase
the  heat  of the  sun  that  this earth would  be  burned,  and  no  ani
mals  in it could  live.  That  he  took  the  three  phenomena,  seen

by Hipparchus,  Tycho  Brahe,  and  Kepler's  disciples,  to have  been
of  this kind,  for he could  not otherwise  account  for  an  extraor
dinary  light, as  those  were,  appearing,  all at  once, among  the
the  fixed  stars  (all which  he took  to be  suns,  enlightening  other
planets,  as our  sun  does  ours),  as big  as Mercury  or Venus  seems
to  us, and  gradually  diminishing,  for  sixteen  months,  and  then
sinking  into nothing.  He  seemed  to  doubt  whether  there  were
not  intelligent  beings,  superior  to  us, who  superintended  these
revolutions  of the heavenly  bodies, by the  direction  of the Supreme
Being.  He  appeared  also  to be very  clearly  of opinion  that  the
inhabitants  of this world  were  of short  date, and  alledged,  as  one
reason  for that opinion,  that  all arts,  as  letters,  ships,  printing,
needle,  &c., were  discovered  within  the memory   of history, which
could  not have  happened   if the world  had  been  eternal  ; and  that
there  were  visible marks  of ruin upon  it which  could  not be
effected by  flood only.  When  I asked  him  how  this earth  could
have  been  repeopled  if ever  it had  undergone  the  same  fate
it was  threatened  with  hereafter, by  the  comet  of 1680,  he
answered,  that  required  the  power  of a Creator.  He  said  he
took  all the  planets  to be composed  of the same  matter  with  this
 earth,  viz. : earth,  water,  stones,  &c.3 but  variously concocted.  J

 asked  him why  he would  not  publish  his  conjectures,  as  conjec
 tures, and  instanced  that Kepler  had  communicated   his ; and

 though  he  had  not  gone  near  so  far  as Kepler,  yet  Kepler's
 guesses  were  so just and  happy  that they had  been  proved  and
 demonstrated  by him.  His  answer  was,  " I do  not  deal  in  con
 jectures."  But,  on my  talking  to him  about  the four observations
 that had  been  made  of the comet  of 1680,  at 574  years'  distance,
and  asking him  the  particular  times,  he opened  his Principia,
which  laid on  the  table, and  showed  me  the  particular  periods,
viz.:  1st. The  Julium  Sidus,  in the  time  of Justinian,  in 1106,
 in 1680.

    " And  I, observing  that he  said  there  of that  comet,   ' incidet
in corpus  solis,' and  in the  next  paragraph  adds,   ' stellae  fixae
 refici possunt,'  told  him  I thought  he owned  there  what  we  had
been  talking  about,  viz. : that  the comet  would  drop  into the  sun,
and  that fixed  stars were  recruited  and  replenished  by  comets
when  they dropped  into them  ; and, consequently,  that  the  sun
would  be recruited  too ; and  asked  him why  he would  not own   as
fully what  he thought  of the  sun  as well  as what  he  thought  of

the  fixed stars.  He  said, 'that concerned  us more;'  and, laugh
ing, added,  that  he  had  said enough  for  people  to know   his

meaning."
   In the summer  of 1725,  a French  translation  of  the chronolo
gical MS.,  of which  the Abbe  Conti  had  been  permitted,  some
time  previous,  to have  a copy,  was  published  at Paris,  in violation
of  all good  faith.  The  Punic  Abbe  had  continued  true  to  his
promise  of secrecy  while  he remained  in England  ; but  no  sooner
did he reach  Paris  than  he placed  the  manuscript  into  the hands
of M.  Freret,  a learned  antiquarian, who  translated  the work,  and
accompanied   it with  an attempted  refutation  of the leading  points
of the system.  In November,  of the same  year, Newton  received
a presentation  copy  of  this  publication,  which  bore  the  title of

was  drawn  up by our  author,  and  printed  in the  Philosophical
Transactions  for 1725.   It contained  a  history  of  the  whole
matter,  and  a triumphant  reply  to  the  objections  of M.  Freret.
This  answer  called  into  the  field a fresh  antagonist,  Father  Soueiet,
whose  five dissertations  on  this subject  were  chiefly remarkable
for the want  of knowledge  and  want  of decorum,  which  they
displayed.  In consequence  of these  discussions, Newton  was  in
duced  to prepare  his larger work  for the  press,  and  had  nearly
completed   it at the time  of his death.   It was  published  in 1728,
under  the  title of THE  CHRONOLOGY   OF THE  ANCIENT  KINGDOMS
AMENDED,   TO WHICH   is PREFIXED   A SHORT  CHRONICLE  FROM  THE

FIRST  MEMORY  OF  THINGS    IN  EUROPE      TO   THE   CONQUEST    OF
PERSIA  BY ALEXANDER  THE GREAT.   It consists  of  six chap
ters:  1. On  the Chronology  of the Greeks;  according  to Whis-
ton, our  author  wrote  out  eighteen  copies  of this chapter  with  his
own  hand,  differing  little from  one  another.  2. Of  the Empire
of Egypt;  3. Of  the Assyrian Empire;  4. Of  the two  contempo
rary Empires  of the  Babylonians  and Medes  ; 5. A  Description
of the Temple  of Solomon  ; 6. Of  the Empire  of the  Persians  ;
this chapter  was  not found  copied  with  the  other  five, but  as  it
was  discovered  among  his papers,  arid appeared  to be  a continu
ation  of  the same  work,  the  Editor  thought  proper  to  add  it

of conversing  with  the aged  and  illustrious author.   " I found,"

cians  than  one  could  have  expected;  but  his own  prodigious

heard  him  censure  the handling  geometrical  subjects  ly algebraic
calculations  ; and  his book  of Algebra  he  called by the name  of
Universal  Arithmetic,  in opposition  to  the  injudicious  title of
Geometry,  which  Descartes  had  given  to the  treatise, wherein  he
shows  how  the geometer  may  assist  his invention  by  such  kind
of computations.  He  thought  Huygens  the  most  elegant  of any
mathematical  writer  of modern  times,  and  the most  just imitator
of the ancients.  Of  their  taste  and form  of demonstration,  Sir
Isaac  always  professed  himself  a  great  admirer.   I have  heard
him  even  censure  himself  for not following  them  yet more  closely
than  he  did  ; and  speak  with  regret  of his mistake  at the begin
ning  of his mathematical  studies,  in applying  himself  to the works
of Descartes  and  other  algebraic  writers,  before  he had considered
the elements  of Euclid  with  that  attention  which  so  excellent  a

writer  deserves."
    " Though  his memory  was  much  decayed,"  continues  Dr. Pem-
berton,  "he  perfectly  understood  his own  writings."  And  even
this failure  of memory,  we  would  suggest,  might  have  been  more
apparent  than  real, or, in medical  terms,  more  the  result  of func
tional weakness  than  organic decay.  Newton  seems  never  to
have  confided  largely  to his memory  : and  as  this  faculty mani
fests the most  susceptibility  to cultivation  ; so, in the  neglect  of
due  exercise,  it more  readily  and  plainly shows  a diminution  of
its powers.
  Equanimity  and  temperance  had,  indeed,  preserved  Newton
singularly  free from  all mental  and  bodily ailment.  His  hair was,
to  the  last, quite  thick, though  as  white  as  silver. He  never
made  use  of spectacles,  and  lost but  one  tooth  to  the  day  of  his
death.  He  was  of middle  stature,  well-knit,  and, in  the  latter
part  of his  life, somewhat  inclined  to be corpulent.  Mr. Conduit

says,  " he had  a very  lively and  piercing  eye,  a comely  and  gra
cious  aspect,  with  a fine head  of hair, white  as  silver, without  any

baldness,  and when  his peruke  was  off was  a  venerable  sight."
According  to Bishop  Atterbury,  "in  the whole  air of his face and
make  there  was  nothing  of  that  penetrating  sagacity  which
appears  in his compositions.  He  had  something  rather  languid
in his look  and manner  which  did  not  raise any  great expectation

in those who  did not know  him."  Hearne  remarks,  " Sir  Isaac
was  a man  of no  very  promising  aspect.  He  was  a  short,  well-
set man.  He  was  full of thought,  and  spoke  very  little  in com
pany,  so  that  his conversation  was  not agreeable.  When  he  rode
in his coach,  one  arm  would  be  out  of his coach  on  one  side and
the  other  on  the  other."  These  different  accounts  we  deem
easily reconcilable.  In the rooms  of the Royal  Society,  in  the

street,  or  in mixed  assemblages,  Newton's  demeanour — always
courteous,  unassuming  and  kindly —  still had  in  it the overawings
of  a profound  repose  and  reticency,  out  of which  the communica

tive  spirit, and  the  "lively and  piercing  eye" would  only gleam
in the  quiet and  unrestrained  freedom  of his own  fire-side.
    " But  this I immediately  discovered  in him,"  adds  Pemberton,
still further, "which  at once  both  surprised  and  charmed  me.
Neither  his extreme  great  age,  nor  his universal  reputation  had
rendered  him  stiff in opinion,  or in any degree  elated.  Of  this I
had  occasion  to have  almost  daily experience.  The  remarks  I
continually  sent him  by  letters  on  his  Principia,  were  received
with  the utmost  goodness.  These  were  so  far from  being  any
ways  displeasing  to him,  that, on  the contrary,  it occasioned  him
to speak many  kind  things  of me  to my  friends, and  to honour  me

with  a public testimony  of his good  opinion."  A  modesty,  open
ness,  and  generosity,  peculiar  to  the  noble  and  comprehensive

spirit of Newton.   " Full  of wisdom  and  perfect  in beauty,"  yet
not  lifted up by pride  nor  corrupted  by ambition.  None,  how
ever, knew   so well  as himself  the stupendousness  of his discoveries
in comparison  with  all that  had  been  previously  achieved  ; and
none  realized  so thoroughly  as himself  the  littleness  thereof  in
comparison  with  the  vast region  still unexplored.  A  short  time
before  his death  he uttered  this memorable  sentiment: —  " I do  not
know  what  I may  appear  to the world  ; but  to myself  I seem  to
have  been  only  like  a boy  playing  on  the  sea-shore,  and  diverting
myself  in now  and  then  finding  a smoother  pebble  or  a  prettier
shell  than  ordinary,  while  the great  ocean  of truth  lay  all undis

covered  before me."  How  few  ever  reach  the  shore  even, much
less  find "a smoother  pebble  or  a prettier  shell!"
   Newton  had  now  resided  about  two  years  at Kensington  ; and

the  air which  he enjoyed  there, and  the  state  of  absolute  rest,
proved  of great  benefit  to him.  Nevertheless  he would  occasion
ally go  to town.  And  on Tuesday,  the 28th  of February,  1727,
he proceeded  to London,  for the purpose  of presiding  at  a meeting
of the Royal  Society.  At  this time  his health  was  considered,
by Mr.  Conduit,  better  than  it had  been  for many  years.  But
the  unusual  fatigue  he was  obliged  to  suffer, in attending  the
meeting,  and  in paying  and  receiving  visits, speedily produced   a
violent  return  of the  affection  in the bladder.  He  returned   to

Kensington  on Saturday,  the 4th  of March.   Dr. Mead  and  Dr.
Cheselden  attended  him  ; they pronounced  his disease  to be  the
stone,  and  held  out no  hopes  of recovery.  On  Wednesday,  the
15th  of March,  he  seemed  a  little better;  and  slight, though
groundless,  encouragement  was  felt that  he  might  survive  the
attack.  From  the very  first of  it, his sufferings  had  been  intense.
Paroxysm  followed  paroxysm,  in quick  succession  : large  drops
 )f sweat  rolled down   his  face ; but  not  a groan,  not  a complaint,
not  the  least mark  of peevishness  or impatience  escaped  him   :
and  during  the  short  intervals  of  relief, he even  smiled  and  con
versed  with  his usual  composure  and  cheerfulness.  The   flesh
quivered,  but  the  heart quaked  not ; the impenetrable  gloom  was
settling down  : the  Destroyer  near ; the  portals  of the  tomb
opening,  still, arnid  this  utter wreck  and  dissolution  of the mortal,
the immortal  remained  serene,  unconquerable  : the  radiant  light
broke  through  the gathering  darkness  ; and Death  yielded  up  its
sting, and  the  grave  its victory.  On  Saturday  morning,  18th,
he read  the newspapers,  and  carried  on  a pretty long conversation
with  Dr. Mead.   His  senses  and  faculties were  then  strong  and

vigorous  ; but  at six o'clock,  the same  evening,  he became  insen
sible  ; and  in this  state  he continued  during  the whole  of Sunday,
and  till Monday,  the  20th, when  he  expired,  between  one  and

two  o'clock  in the morning,  in the  eighty-fifth  year  of his  age.
   And  these  were  the  last days  of Isaac Newton.  Thus  closed

the  career  of one  of earth's  greatest  and  best men.  His  mission
was  fulfilled.  Unto  the Giver,  in many-fold  addition,  the  talents
were  returned.  While   it was  yet  day he  had  worked  ; and  for
the night  that quickly  cometh  he was  not unprepared.  Full  of

years,  ind  full of honours,  the heaven-sent  was  recalled  ; and,  in

the confidence  of  a  " certain  hope,"  peacefully  he  passed  awa}'
into  the  silent depths  of Eternity.
   His body  was  placed  in Westminster  Abbey,  with  the  state
and  ceremonial  that  usually  attended  the  interment  of the  most
distinguished.  In 1731,  his relatives,  the inheritors  of his personal
estate,  erected  a monument   to his memory   in the  most  conspicu
ous  part  of the Abbey,  which  had  often  been  refused  by the dean

and  chapter  to the  greatest  of England's  nobility.  During  the
same  year  a medal  was  struck  at the Tower  in  his honour  ; arid,
in 1755,  a full-length  statue  of him,  in white  marble,  admirably
executed,  by Roubiliac,  at the expense  of Dr. Robert  Smith,  was
erected  in the  ante-chamber  of  Trinity  College,  Cambridge.
There   is a painting  executed  in the glass  of  one  of  the windows
of the same  college, made  pursuant  to the  will  of Dr.  Smith, who
left five hundred  pounds  for that purpose.
  Newton   left  a personal  estate  of about  thirty-two  thousand
pounds.   It was  divided  among  his four nephews  and  four  nieces
of the  half blood,  the grand-children  of his mother,  by  the Reve
rend  Mr. Smith.  The  family  estates  of Woolsthorpe   arid Sustern
fell to John  Newton,  the  heir-at-law,  whose  great  grand-father
was  Sir Isaac's uncle.  Before  his death  he made  an  equitable
distribution  of his two  other  estates  : the one  in Berkshire  to the
sons  and  daughter  of a brother  of Mrs.  Conduit  ; and  the  other,
at Kensington,  to Catharine,  the  only daughter  of Mr.  Conduit,
and who  afterward  became  Viscountess  Lymington.  Mr.  Con
duit succeeded  to the  offices  of  the Mint,  the  duties  of which  he

had  discharged  during  the  last two  years  of Sir  Isaac's  life.

chiefly,  in the possession  of the  family  of the  Earl  of Portsmouth,
through  the Viscountess  Lymington.
  Everything  appertaining  to Newton  has  been  kept  and  che
rished  with  peculiar veneration.  Different  memorials  of him  are
preserved  in Trinity  College,  Cambridge  ; in the rooms  of  the
Royal  Society,  of London   : and  in the Museum  of  the Royal
Society  of Edinburgh.
  The  manor-house,  at Woolsthorpe,  was  visited  by Dr.  Stuke
ley, in October,  1721,  who,  in a  letter  to Dr.  Mead,  written  in

1727,  gave  the following  description  of  it: —   " 'Tis  built  of stone,
as  is the way  of the  country  hereabouts,  and  a  reasonably  good

one.  They  led me  up  stairs and  showed  me  Sir  Isaac's  stud}-,
where  I supposed  he  studied, when  in the country,  in his younger
days,  or perhaps  when  he  visited  his mother  from  the University.
I observed  the  shelves  were  of his own  making,  being  pieces  of
deal boxes,  which  probably  he  sent  his books  and  clothes  down
in on  those  occasions.  There  were,  some  years  ago, two  or  threr
hundred  books  in it of his  father-in-law,  Mr.  Smith,  which  Sir

Isaac  gave  to Dr. Newton,  of our town."  The  celebrated  apple-
tree, the  fall of one  of the apples  of which  is said  to have  turned
the  attention  of Newton   to the  subject  of gravity,  was  destroyed
by the wind  about  twenty  years  ago ; but  it has  been  preserved
in the form  of a chair.  The  house  itself has  been  protected  with
religious care.  It was  repaired  in 1798,  and  a  tablet  of white
marble  put up  in the room  where  our  author  was  born,  with  the
follow, ng inscription   :—
    " Sir Isaac Newton,  son  of John  Newton,  Lord  of  the Manor
of Woolsthorpe,  was  born  in this room,  on  the 25th  of December,

 1642."

            THE    AUTHOR'S   PREFACE


   SINCE  the ancients  (as we  are  told by Pappus),  made  great  account  oi
the science  of mechanics  in the investigation  of natural  things  : and  the
moderns,  laying  aside  substantial  forms  and  occult  qualities, have  endeav
oured  to subject  the phenomena  of  nature  to the laws  of mathematics,  I
have  in  this treatise  cultivated  mathematics  so far  as it regards  philosophy.
The  ancients  considered  mechanics  in a twofold  respect  ; as rational, which
proceeds  accurately  by demonstration  ; and  practical.  To  practical  me
chanics  all the manual  arts belong, from  which  mechanics  took  its name.
Rut  as  artificers  do not work  with  perfect accuracy,  it comes  to pass  that
mechanics  is so distinguished  from  geometry,  that what  is perfectly  accu
rate  is called geometrical  , what  is less  so, is called mechanical.  But  the
errors  are  not  in the  art, but  in the  artificers. He  that works  with  less
accuracy  is an  imperfect  mechanic  ; and  if any  could  work  with  perfect
accuracy,  he would  be the most  perfect mechanic  of all ; for the description
 if right  lines and  circles, upon  which  geometry  is founded,  belongs  to me
chanics.  Geometry  does not  teach  us  to draw  these  lines, but  requires
them  to be drawn  ; for  it requires  that  the learner  should  f.rst be taught
to describe  these  accurately,  before  he  enters  upon  geometry  ; then  it shows
how  by these  operations  problems  may  be solved.  To  describe  right  lines
and  circles  are problems,  but  not  geometrical  problems.  The  solution  of
these  problems  is required  from  mechanics  ; and  by geometry  the  use  of
them, when  so solved,  is shown  ; and  it is the glory  of geometry  that from
those  few  principles, brought  from  without,  it is able  to  produce  so many
things.  Therefore  geometry  is founded  in mechanical  practice, and  is
nothing  but  that  part  of universal  mechanics  which  accurately  proposes
and  demonstrates  the  art  of measuring.  But  since  the manual  arts  are
chiefly conversant  in the moving  of bodies,  it comes  to pass  that geometry
is commonly  referred  to their magnitudes,  and  mechanics  to their  motion.
In  this sense  rational  mechanics  will be the  science  of motions  resulting
from  any  forces  whatsoever,  and  of the  forces  required  to produce  any  mo
tions, accurately  proposed  and demonstrated.  This  part  of mechanics  was

cultivated  by  the ancients  in the  five powers  which  relate  to manual   arts,
who  considered  gravity  (it not  being  a manual  power),  ho  Otherwise  than
as it moved  weights  by those powers.  Our  design  not  respecting  arts, but
philosophy,  and  our  subject  not  manual  but  natural  powers,  we  consider
chiefly  those  things which  relate  to gravity,  levity,  elastic  force, the  resist
ance  of  fluids, and  the  like  forces, whether  attractive  or impulsive  ; and
therefore  we  offer this work  as the mathematical  principles  :f philosophy  ; for
all the  difficulty  of philosophy  seems  to consist  in this — from  the phenom
ena  of motions  to investigate  the  forces  of  nature,  and  then  from  these
forces  to demonstrate  the other phenomena  ; and  to this end  the  general
propositions  in the  first and  second  book  are directed.  In  the  third  book
we  give  an example  of this in the explication  of the System  of the World   :
for by the  propositions  mathematically  demonstrated  in the former  books,
we  in the  third  derive  from  the  celestial phenomena  the  forces  of gravity
with  which  bodies  tend  to the  sun  and  the several planets.  Then  from  these
forces, by other  propositions  which  are  also mathematical,  we deduce  the mo
tions  of the planets,  the comets,  the moon,  and  the sea.  I wish  we  could  do-
rive  the  rest  of the phenomena   of nature  by the same  kind  of reasoning  from
mechanical  principles;  for I am  induced  by many  reasons  to suspect  that
they may  all depend  upon  certain  forces by which  the  particles  of  bodies.
by some  causes  hitherto  unknown,  are  either  mutually  impelled  towards
each  other, and  cohere  in regular  figures,  or  are  repelled  and  recede  from
each  other; which  forces  being  unknown,  philosophers  have  hitherto  at
tempted  the search  of nature  in vain ; but  I hope  the principles  here  laid
down  will  afford some  light either  to this  or some  truer method  of philosophy.
   In  the publication  of this work  the most  acute  and  universally  learned
Mr. Edmund  H alley not  only  assisted  me  with  his pains  in correcting  the
press  and  taking  care  of the schemes,  but  it was  to his solicitations  that  its
becoming  public  is owing ; for when  he had  obtained  of me my demonstra
tions  of  the  figure of  the  celestial  orbits, he continually  pressed me  to com
municate  the same  to the Royal  Societ //, who  afterwards,  by their kind  en
couragement  and  entreaties,  engaged  me  to think  of publishing them.  But
after  I had begun  to consider  the  inequalities  of the  lunar  motions,  and
had  entered  upon  some  other  things  relating  to the laws  and  measures  oi
gravity,  and  other  forces  : and  the  figures  that would  be described  by bodies
attracted  according  to given  laws  ; and  the motion  of several  bodies moving
among  themselves;  the motion  of bodies  in resisting mediums;  the  forces,
densities, and  motions,  of rn( Hums  ; the orbits  of the comets,  and  such  like ;

could  put forth  the whole  together.  What  relates  to the lunar  motions  (be

   In the second  edition  the second  section  of  the  first book  was  enlarged.
In the seventh  section  of the second  book  the theory  of the resistances  of fluids
was  more  accurately  investigated,  and  confirmed  by new  experiments.  In

the  third  book  the moon's  theory  and  the profession  of the equinoxes  were
more  fully deduced  from  their  principles  ; and  the  theory  of  the comets
was  confirmed  by more  examples  of the  calculati  >n  of  their  orbits, done
also with  greater  accuracy.
   In  this third  edition  the  resistance  of mediums   is somewhat  more  largely
handled  than  before;  and  new  experiments  of the  resistance  of heavy
bodies  falling  in air are added.  In  the  third  book,  the argument  to prove
that  the moon   is retained  in  its orbit by the  force  of  gravity  is enlarged

on  ; and  there  are added  new  observations  of Mr.  Pound's  of the proportion
of the diameters  of Ju.piter  to each  other  : there  are, besides, added  Mr.

Kirk's  observations  of the  comet  in 16SO ; the  orbit  of  that comet  com

 NATURAL   PHILOSOPHY



            DEFINITIONS.

                   DEFINITION    I.

 77w? quantity  of matter  is the measure  of the same,  arising from   its
                       density and  hulk  conjutictly.

  THUS  air  of  a double  density,  in a double  space,  is quadruple  in quan-
ti ty ; in a triple space,  sextuple  in quantity.  The  same  thing  is to be un
derstood  of snow,  and  fine dust  or powders,  that  are condensed  by compres

sion  or liquefaction  • and  of  all bodies  that  are by any  causes  whatever
differently condensed.  I have  no  regard  in this place  to  a medium,  if any
such  there  is, that  freely pervades  the  interstices  between  the  parts  oi
bodies.  It is this quantity  that  I mean  hereafter  everywhere  under  the
name  of body  or mass.  And  the same  is known  by the weight  of  each
body ; for  it is proportional  to the weight,  as I have  found  by experiments
on pendulums,  very  accurately  made,  which  shall  be shewn  hereafter.

                   DEFINITION    II.

The  quantity  of motion  is the measure  nf  tlie same,  arising from  the
                 velocity and  quantity  of matter  corjunctly.

  The  motion  of the whole   i<! the sum  of the motions  of  all the parts ; and
therefore  in a body  double  in quantity,  with  equal  velocity,  the motion  is
iouble  ; with  twice  the  velocity,  it is quadruple,

                   DEFINITION    III.

The  vis insita, or  innate  force  of matter,  is  a power  of resisting,  hy
  which  every  body,  as much  as  in  it lies, endeavours   to persevere  in  its
  present  stale, whether  it be of  rest, or of moving  uniformly  forward
   in a right  line.
   This  force  is ever  proportional  to the body  whose  force  it is ; and  differs
nothing  from  the inactivity  of  the mass,  but  in our manner  of  conceiving

 it.  A  body, from  the inactivity  of matter,  is not without  difficulty put out
 of  its state  of  rest  or motion.  Upon  which  account,  this vis  insita, may,
by  a most  significant  name,  be  called  vis  inertia,  or  force  of  inactivity.
 Hut  a body  exerts  this  force  only, when  another  force, impressed  upon  it,
endeavours  to change  its condition  ; and  the  exercise  of  this  force may  bo
considered  both  as resistance  and  impulse ; it is resistance,  in so far  as the
body,  for maintaining  its present  state, withstands  the force  impressed;  it
 is impulse,  in so far  as the body, by not  easily giving way  to the impressed
force  of another,  endeavours  to change  the  state  of that other.  Resistance
is usually  ascribed  to bodies  at  rest, and  impulse  to  those  in motion;
but  motion  and  rest,  as commonly  conceived,  are  only  relatively  distin
guished  ; nor  are  those  bodies  always  truly  at  rest, which  commonly  are
taken  to be  so.

                  DKFLMTIOX    IV.

 Ait impressed  force  is an  action  exerted  upon  a body,  in order  to change
    its state,  either  of  rest, or  of moving  uniformly  forward  in  a right
    line.

   This  force  consists  in  the  action  only;  and  remains  no  longer  in  the
body, when  the  action  is over.  For  a body  maintains  every  new  state  it

acquires,  by its vis  inertice only.  Impressed  forces  are  of differe.it  origins      •
as from  percussion,  from  pressure, from  centripetal  force.

                   DEFINITION   V.

A  centripetal  force  is that by which  bodies  are drawn  or impelled,  or any
  way  tend, towards  a point  as  to a  centre.

   Of  this  sort  is gravity, by which  bodies  tend  to the centre  of the  earth
magnetism,  by which  iron tends  to  the  loadstone  ; and  that  force, what
ever  it is, by which  the  planets  are perpetually  drawn  aside from  the  rec
tilinear  motions,  which  otherwise  they would  pursue,  and made  to revolve
in curvilinear  orbits.  A  stone, whirled  about  in  a sling, endeavours  to  re
cede from  the hand  that  turns  it ; and  by that  endeavour,  distends  the
sling, and  that  with  so much  the greater  force, as  it is revolved  with  the
greater  velocity,  and  as soon  as  ever  it is let go,  flies away.  That  force
which  opposes  itself  to this endeavour,  and  by which  the  sling perpetually
draws  back  the  stone  towards  the hand,  and  retains  it in  its orbit, because
it is directed  to the hand  as the  centre  of the  orbit, I  call the centripetal
force.  And  the  same  thing  is to be understood  of  all bodies, revolved  in
any  orbits.  They  all endeavour  to recede  from  the centres  of their  orbits ;
and  wore  it not  for the opposition  of a contrary  force which  restrains  them
to, and  detains  them  in their  orbits, which  I therefore  call centripetal,  would
tiy off in right  lines, with  an  uniform  motion.  A  projectile,  if  it was  not
for the  force  of  gravity, would  not  deviate  towards  the  earth, tut would

| of its state of | rest or | motion. | Upon which | acc | ount, this v | is | insita, may, |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| is usually asc | ribed to | bodies at | rest, and | imp | ulse to tho | se | in motion; |
| but motion a | nd rest, | as common | ly concei | ved, | are only re | lati | vely distin |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| guished ; nor | are tho | se bodies a | lways trul | y at | rest, which | co | mmonly are |

go  off from  it in  a right  line, and  that  with  an  uniform  motion,, if the  re
sistance  of the  air was  taken away.   It is by  its gravity  that  it is drawn
aside  perpetually  from  its rectilinear  course,  and made  to deviate  towards
the  earth, more  or  less, according  to the  force  of  its gravity, and  the  velo
city of its motion.  The  less  its gravity  is, for the quantity  of  its matter,
or the greater  the velocity  with  which  it is projected,  the  less will  it devi
ate from  a rectilinear  course,  and  the farther  it will go.  If  a leaden  balJ,
projected  from  the top of  a mountain  by the  force  of gunpowder  with  a
given  velocity, and  in a direction  parallel  to the  horizon,  is carried  in  a
curve  line  to the  distance  of two  miles  before  it falls  to the ground  ; the
same,  if the  resistance  of the  air were  taken  away,  with  a double  or decuple
velocity, would  fly twice  or ten  times  as far.  And  by increasing  the  velo
city, we may  at pleasure  increase  the distance  to which  it might  be  pro
jected, and  diminish  the curvature  of the  line, which  it might  describe,  till
at last  it should  fall  at the  distance  of 10, 30, or 90 degrees,  or even  might
go  quite round  the whole  earth  before  it falls ; or lastly, so that  it might
never  fall to the  earth, but go forward  into  the  celestial  spaces,  and  pro
ceed  in its motion  in iiifiuitum.  And  after  the same  manner  that  a pro
jectile, by the  force  of gravity, may  be made  to revolve  in an  orbit, and  go
round  the whole  earth,  the moon  also, either by the  force of  gravity,  if  it
is endued  with  gravity,  or by any  other  force, that  impels  it towards  the
earth, may  be perpetually  drawn  aside towards  the  earth,  out  of the r&ti-
linear  way,  which  by  its innate  force  it would  pursue;  and  would  be made
to revolve  in the  orbit which   it now  describes  ; nor  could  the moon  with
out some  such  force, be retained  in  its orbit.  If this  force  was  too  small,
it would  not  sufficiently  turn  the moon  out  of a  rectilinear  course  : if  it
was  too  great,  it would  turn  it too much,  arid draw  down  the moon  from
its orbit towards  the  earth.  It  is necessary,  that  the  force  be  of a just
quantity,  and  it belongs  to the mathematicians  to find the  force, that may
serve  exactly  to retain  a body  in  a given  orbit, with  a given  velocity ; and
vice  versa,  to determine  the curvilinear  way,  into which  a body  projected
from  a given  place, with  a given  velocity, may  be made  to deviate  from
its natural  rectilinear  way, by means  of  a given  force.
  The  quantity  of any  centripetal  force may  be  considered  as  of three
kinds;  aboolu'e,  accelerative,  and  motive.

                   DEFINITION   VI.

The  absolute  quantity  of a centripetal  force  is the measure   f>f the same
  proportional  to the efficacy of the cause  that propagates   it from  the cen
   tre, through  the spaces  round  about.

  Thus  the magnetic  force  is greater  in one  load-stone  and  less in another
according  to their  sizes and  strength  of intensity.

76             THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES


                   DEFINITION   VII.

 The  accelerative  quantity  of a  centripetal  force  is the measure,  of  tht
   same,  proportional  to the velocity which   it generates  in  a given  time.

   Thus  the  force  of  the same  load-stone  is greater  at a less distance,  and
less at  a greater  : also the  force  of gravity  is greater  in  valleys,  less  on
tops  of exceeding  high mountains  ; and  yet  less (as shall  hereafter  be shown),
at  greater  distances  from  the body  of  the  earth ; but  at equal  distan
ces, it is the same  everywhere ; because  (taking  away,  or allowing  for, the
resistance  of the  air), it equally  accelerates  all falling  bodies, whether  heavy
or light, great  or small.

                   DEFINITION   VIII.

 TJie motive  quantity  of  a centripetal  force,  is the measure  of the  samt\
  proportional  to the motion  which  it generates  in  a given  twip.
   Thus  the weight  is greater  in  a greater  body,  less in a  less body ; and.
in the same  body,  it  is greater  near  to the  earth, and  less  at remoter  dis
tances.  This  sort  of quantity  is the  centripetency,  or propension  of  the
whole  body  towards  the  centre,  or, as  I may  say,  its weight ; and  it is al
ways known  by the quantity  of an  equal  and  contrary  force  just  sufficient
to Ifinder  the descent  of the body.

   These  quantities  of forces, we  may,  for brevity's  sake,  call by the names
of motive,  accelerative,  and  absolute  forces ; and, for distinction's  sake,  con
sider them,  with  respect  to the  bodies  that  tend  to the centre ; to the places
of those  bodies  ; and  to the centre  of  force towards  which  they  tend  ; that
is to say, I refer  the motive  force  to the body  as  an  endeavour  and  propen
sity of  the whole  towards  a centre,  arising from  the  propensities  of  the
several  parts taken  together ; the  accelerative  force  to  the  place  of  the
body,  as  a certain  power  or energy  diffused from  the  centre  to  all  places
around  to move  the  bodies  that  are  in them  : and  the  absolute  force  to
the centre,  as endued  with  some  cause,  without  which  those  motive  forces
would  not  be propagated  through  the  spaces  round  about  ; whether  that
cause  be some  central  body  (siuh  as is the load-stone,  in  the centre  of  the
magnetic  force,  or  the  earth  in  the  centre  of the  gravitating  force),  or
anything  else that  does  not  yet appear.  For  I here  design  only  to give  a
mathematical  notion  of  those  forces, without  considering  their  physical
causes  and  seats.
   Wherefore  the accelerative  force  will stand  in the same  relation  to  the
motive,  as celerity  does  to motion.  For  the quantity  of motion  arises from
the  celerity drawn  into  the quantity  of matter  : and  the motive  force  arises
from  the  accelerative  force drawn  into  the same  quantity  of matter.  For
the sum  of the  actions  of  the  accelerative  force, upon  the several  ; articles
of  the body,  is the motive  force of  the whole.  Hence  it  is, that  near  the

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The accelerative | quantity | of a centripeta | l for | ce is the | measure | , of tht |
| same, proportio | nal to th | e velocity which | it ge | nerates in | a give | n time. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Thus the force | of the | same load-stone | is gre | ater at a le | ss dista | nce, and |
| less at a greater : | also the | force of gravit | y is | greater in | valleys, | less on |
| tops of exceeding | high mou | ntains ; a nd yet | less ( | as shall here | after be | shown), |
| at greater distan | ces from | the body of th | e ear | th ; but a | t equal | distan |
| ces, it is the same | everywhe | re ; b ecause (t | aking | away, or a | llowing | for, the |
| resistance of the | air), it eq | ually accelerates | all fa | lling bodies, | whethe | r heavy |
| or light, great or | small. |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  | DEFINITION | VIII. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| TJie motive quant | ity of a | centripetal forc | e, is | the measure | of t | he samt\ |
| proportional to | the moti | on which it gen | erates | in a give | n twip. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Thus the weigh | t is grea | ter in a greater | body, | less in a | less bo | dy ; and. |
| in the same body, | it is gre | ater near to the | earth | , and less | at remo | ter dis |
| tances. This sor | t of qua | ntity is the cen | tripet | ency, or pr | opensio | n of the |
| whole body toward | s the ce | ntre, or, as I ma | y say | , its weight | ; and | it is al |
| ways known by t | he quanti | ty of an equal a | nd co | ntrary forc | e just | sufficient |
| to Ifinder the desce | nt of the | body. |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| These quantitie | s of forc | es, we may, for | brevit | y's sake, ca | ll by t | he names |
| of motive, accelera | tive, and | absolute forces | ; and, | for distinct | ion's s | ake, con |
| sider them, with | respect to | the bodies that | tend | to the centr | e ; to t | he places |
| of those bodies ; a | nd to the | centre of force | towar | ds which | they te | nd ; t hat |
| is to say, I refer | the motive | force to the bo | dy as | an endeavo | ur and | propen |
| sity of the whole | towards | a centre, arisin | g fro | m the prop | ensitie | s of the |
| several parts take | n togethe | r ; the accelera | tive | force to t | he plac | e of the |
| body, as a certain | power or | energy diffused | from | the centr | e to a | ll places |
| around to move | the bodi | es that are in | them | : and the a | bsolute | force to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the centre, as end | ued with | some cause, with | out | which those | motiv | e forces |
| would not be prop | agated | through the spa | ces r | ound about | ; whet | her that |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| cause be some cen | tral body | (siuh as is the | load-s | tone, in th | e centr | e of the |

| Wherefore the | accelerati | ve force will sta | nd in | the same | relatio | n to the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| motive, as celerity | does to | motion. For th | e quan | tity of mot | ion ari | ses from |
| the celerity drawn | into the | quantity of mat | ter : | and the mot | ive for | ce arises |
| from the accelerat | ive force | drawn into the | same | quantity o | f matt | er. For |

surface  of  the earth, where  the accelerative  gravity,  or force productive  of
gravity,  in  all bodies  is the  same,  the motive  gravity  or the weight  is as
the body : but  if we  should  ascend  to higher  regions, where  the accelerative
gravity  is less, the weight  would  be equally  diminished,  and would  always
be  as the product  of the body, by  the accelerative  gravity.  So  in those  re
gions, where  the  accelerative  gravity  is diminished  into one  half, the weight
of a body  two  or three  times  less, will  be four  or  six times  less.
   I likewise  call attractions  and  impulses,  in the same  sense,  accelerative,
and  motive  ; and  use  the words  attraction,  impulse  or  propensity  of any
sort  towards  a centre,  promiscuously,  and  indifferently,  one  for  another  ;
considering  those  forces  not  physically,  but mathematically   : wherefore,  the
reader  is not  to imagine,  that by those  words,  I anywhere  take upon  me  to
define  the kind,  or  the manner  of  any  action,  the causes  or the  physical
reason  thereof,  or that  I attribute  forces,  in a true  and  physical  sense,  to
certain  centres  (which  are  only mathematical  points) ; when  at any time  I
happen  to speak  of centres  as  attracting,  or  as endued  with  attractive
powers.

                      SCHOLIUM.

   Hitherto  I have  laid down  the  definitions  of  such words  as  are  less
known,  and  explained  the  sense  in which  I would  have  them  to be under
stood  in the  following  discourse.  I do  not  define  time,  space,  place and
motion,  as being  well known  to all.  Only  I must  observe,  that  the vulgar
conceive  those  quantities  under  no  other  notions  but from  the relation  they
bear  to  sensible  objects. And  thence  arise  certain  prejudices,  for the  re
moving  of which,  it will  be convenient  to distinguish  them  into  absolute
and  relative,  true  and  apparent,  mathematical  and common.
   I. Absolute,  true, and mathematical  time,  of itself, and  from  its own  na
ture  flows equably  without  regard  to anything  external,  and  by another
name  is called  duration   : relative,  apparent,  and common  time,  is some  sen
sible and  external  (whether  accurate  or unequable)  measure  of duration  by
the means  of motion,  which  is commonly  used  instead  of  true  time ; such
as an hour,  a day,  a month,  a year.
   II. Absolute  space,  in  its own  nature,  without  regard  to anything  exter
nal, remains  always  similar  and  immovable.     Relative  space  is some  mo
vable dimension  or measure  of  the absolute  spaces  ; which  our  senses  de
termine  by  its position  to bodies  ; and  which  is vulgarly  taken  for immo
vable  space ; such  is the dimension  of  a subterraneous,  an  aereal,  or celestial
space, determined  by  its position  in respect  of the  earth.    Absolute  and
relative  space,  are  the same  in figure and magnitude ; but  they do  not  re
main  always  numerically  the  same.    For  if the  earth,  for instance,  moves,
a space  of our  air, which  relatively  and  in respect  of the earth  remains  al
ways  the  same,  will  at one  time  be one  part of the absolute  space  into which

| gravity, in all b | odies is the s | ame, the moti | ve gravity or the | weight is as |

| gravity is less, th | e weight would | be equally | diminished, and wo | uld always |
| be as the product | of the body, b | y the accele | rative gravity. So | in those re |
| gions, where the | accelerative gr | avity is dimi | nished into one half | , the weight |
| of a body two or | three times les | s, will be fo | ur or six times less. |  |
| I likewise call | attractions and | impulses, | in the same sense, | accelerative, |
| and motive ; and | use the words | attraction, | impulse or propen | sity of any |
| sort towards a ce | ntre, promiscu | ously, and | indifferently, one f | or another ; |
| considering those | forces not phy | sically, but | mathematically : wh | erefore, the |
| reader is not to i | magine, that b | y those word | s, I anywhere take | upon me to |
| define the kind, | or the manner | of any act | ion, the causes or | the physical |

| Hitherto I ha | ve laid down | the definit | ions of such words | as are less |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| known, and expl | ained the sens | e in which I | would have them | to be under |
| stood in the fol | lowing discour | se. I do n | ot define time, spac | e, place and |
| motion, as being | well known to | all. Only | I must observe, tha | t the vulgar |
| conceive those qu | antities under | no other no | tions but from the | relation they |
| bear to sensible | objects. And | thence aris | e certain prejudices, | for the re |
| moving of which | , it will be c | onvenient to | distinguish them i | nto absolute |
| and relative, true | and apparent, | mathematic | al and common. |  |
| I. Absolute, tr | ue, and mathem | atical time, | of itself, and from | its own na |
| ture flows equabl | y without rega | rd to anyt | hing external, and | by another |
| name is called du | ration : relativ | e, apparent, | and common time, | is some sen |
| sible and external | (whether acc | urate or uneq | uable) measure of | duration by |
| the means of mot | ion, which is | commonly u | sed instead of true | time ; such |
| as an hour, a day | , a month, a y | ear. |  |  |
| II. Absolute s | pace, in its own | nature, wit | hout regard to any | thing exter |
| nal, remains alwa | ys similar and | immovable. | Relative space | is some mo |
| vable dimension | or measure of | the absolute | spaces ; which our | senses de |

| vable space ; such | is the dimens | ion of a subt | erraneous, an aereal, | or celestial |

the  air passes  ; at another  time  it will  be another  part  of the same,  and  so.
absolutely  understood,  it will  be perpetually  mutable.
   III. Place  is a part  of space  which  a body  takes  up, and  is according  to
the space,  either  absolute  or relative.   I say,  a part  of space  ; not  the situation,
nor  the external  surface  of  the  body.    For  the places of equal  solids  are
always  equal ; but  their  superfices, by reason  of their dissimilar  figures,  are
often  unequal.    Positions  properly  have  no  quantity,  nor  are they  so much
the  places themselves,  as the properties  of places.    The  motion  of the whole
is the same  thing  with  the sum  of  the motions  of the  parts ; that  is, the
translation  of  the whole,  out  of  its place,  is the same  thing  with  the sum
of the translations  of the parts  out  of their  places ; and  therefore  the place
of the whole  is the same  thing  with  the sum  of the places  of the parts, and
for that  reason,  it is internal,  and  in the whole  body.
   IV. Absolute  motion  is the  translation  of a body from  one  absolute
place  into another  ; and  relative  motion,  the translation  from  one  relative
place  into  another.    Thus  in  a ship under  sail, the relative  place of a body
is that  part  of the ship which  the body  possesses  ; or that part  of its cavity
which  the body  fills, and which  therefore  moves  together  with  the  ship :
and  relative  rest  is the continuance  of  the body  in the same  part  of  the
ship,  or of  its cavity.    But  real, absolute  rest, is the  continuance  of  the
body  in the same  part  of that immovable  space,  in which  the  ship  itself,
its cavity, and  all that  it contains,  is moved.    Wherefore,  if the  earth  is
really  at  rest, the body, which  relatively  rests  in the  ship, will  really and
absolutely  move  with  the same  velocity which  the ship has  on  the  earth.
But  if the  earth  also moves,  the  true and  absolute  motion  of the body  will
arise, partly from  the  true motion  of the earth,  in immovable  space  ; partly
from  the  relative  motion  of  the ship on  the  earth ; and  if the body moves
also relatively  in the ship ; its true motion  will  arise, partly from  the true
motion  of the earth,  in immovable  space,  and  partly from  the  relative mo
tions  as well  of the ship on  the  earth,  as  of the body  in the ship ; and from
these  relative  motions  will  arise  the  relative  motion  of the  body on  the
earth.   As  if that  part of the  earth, where  the ship  is, was  truly moved
toward  the  east, with  a velocity  of 10010  parts;  while  the ship  itself, with
a fresh  gale, and  full  sails, is carried  towards  the  west, with  a velocity  ex
pressed  by 10  of  those  parts ; but  a sailor walks  in the ship towards  the
east, with  1 part  of  the  said  velocity ; then  the  sailor  will  be moved  truly
in immovable  space towards  the  east, with  a velocity  of 10001  parts, and
relatively  on  the  earth  towards  the  west, with  a velocity  of 9 of those  parts.
   Absolute  time,  in astronomy,  is distinguished  from  relative, by the equa
tion  or correction  of the vulgar time.  For  the natural  days  are tr^y  un
equal, though  they  are commonly  considered  as equal, and  used  for  a meas
ure  of  time ; astronomers  correct  this  inequality  for their more  accurate
deducing  of  the  celestial motions.   It may  be, that  there  is no  such  thing
as  an  equable  motion,  whereby  time may H  accurately measured.  All mo

| absolutely u | nderstood | , it will be | perpetually | mutable. |  |  |
| III. Place | is a par | t of space w | hich a body | takes up, an | d is acc | ording to |
| the space, eit | her absol | ute or relativ | e. I s ay, a | part of space ; | n ot the | situation, |
| nor the exte | rnal surf | ace of the b | ody. For | the places of | equal s | olids are |
| always equal | ; b ut th | eir superfice | s, by reason | of their dissi | milar fi | gures, are |
| often unequal | . Posi | tions proper | ly have no | quantity, nor | are they | so much |
| the places th | emselves, | as the prope | rties of pla | ces. The mot | ion of | the whole |
| is the same | thing wi | th the sum | of the moti | ons of the pa | rts ; t h | at is, t he |
| translation | of the w | hole, out of | its place, i | s the same thi | ng with | the sum |
| of the transl | ations of | the parts o | ut of their | places ; and th | erefore | the place |
| of the whole | is the s | ame thing w | ith the sum | of the places | of the | parts, and |
| for that reas | on, it is | internal, an | d in the who | le body. |  |  |
| IV. Absol | ute moti | on is the | translation | of a body fr | om one | absolute |
| place into an | other ; | and relative | motion, the | translation f | rom one | relative |
| place into an | other. | Thus in a s | hip under s | ail, the relativ | e place | of a body |
| is that part | of the sh | ip which the | body posse | sses ; or that | part of | its cavity |
| which the bo | dy fills, | and which | therefore m | oves together | with | the ship : |
| and relative | rest is t | he continuan | ce of the | body in the s | ame par | t of the |
| ship, or of i | ts cavity. | But real, | absolute re | st, is the con | tinuanc | e of the |
| body in the | same par | t of that im | movable sp | ace, in which | the sh | ip itself, |
| its cavity, a | nd all th | at it contains | , is moved. | Wherefore, | if the | earth is |
| really at rest | , the bod | y, which re | latively res | ts in the ship, | will r | eally and |
| absolutely m | ove with | the same v | elocity whic | h the ship ha | s on t | he earth. |
| But if the e | arth also | moves, the | true and ab | solute motion | of the | body will |
| arise, partly | from the | true motion | of the eart | h, in immovabl | e space | ; partly |
| from the rel | ative mot | ion of the | ship on the | earth ; and if | the bo | dy moves |
| also relative | ly in the | ship ; i ts tr | ue motion | will arise, part | ly from | the true |
| motion of th | e earth, | in immovable | space, and | partly from | the rela | tive mo |
| tions as well | of the s | hip on the e | arth, as of | the body in the | ship ; | and from |
| these relativ | e motions | will arise | the relativ | e motion of | the bod | y on the |
| earth. As | if that | part of the | earth, where | the ship is, | w as tru | ly moved |
| toward the e | ast, with | a velocity | of 10010 pa | rts; while the | ship it | self, with |
| a fresh gale, | and full | sails, is car | ried towards | the west, wi | th a vel | ocity ex |
| pressed by | 10 of th | ose parts ; | b ut a sailor | walks in the | ship tow | ards the |
| east, with 1 | part of | the said velo | city ; t hen | the sailor will | be mov | ed truly |
| in immovable | space | towards the | east, with a | velocity of 1 | 0001 p | arts, and |
| relatively on | the eart | h towards t | he west, with | a velocity of | 9 of th | ose parts. |
| Absolute | time, in | astronomy, i | s distinguis | hed from relat | ive, by | the equa |
| tion or corre | ction of | the vulgar | time. For | the natural da | ys are | tr^y un |

tions may  be accelerated  and  retarded;  but  the  true,  or equable,  progress  of
absolute  time  is liable  to no change.  The  duration  or perseverance  of the
existence  of things remains  the same,  whether  the motions  are  swift  or slow,
or none  at  all : and  therefore  it ought  to be  distinguished  from  what  are
only sensible  measures  thereof  ; and  out  of which  we  collect  it, by means
of the astronomical  equation.  The  necessity  of which  equation,  for deter
mining  the times  of  a phamomenon,   is evinced  as well from  the experiments
of the pendulum  clock,  as by  eclipses  of the  satellites  of Jupiter.
  As  the  order  of  the parts of  time  is immutable,  so  also  is the order  of
the parts  of space.  Suppose  those  parts  to be moved  out  of their  places, and
they  will  be moved  (if the expression may  be allowed)  out  of themselves.
For  times  and  spaces  are, as  it were,  the places  as well  of themselves  as of
all other things.  All things  are  placed  in time  as to order  of succession  ;
and  in space  as  _to order  of situation.  It is from  their  essence  or nature
that  they  are  places ; and  that  the primary  places  of things  should  be
moveable,  is absurd.  These  are  therefore  the absolute  places ; and  trans
lations  out  of those  places,  are  the only  absolute  motions.
  But  because  the parts  of space  cannot  be seen,  or distinguished  from  one
another  by our  senses,  therefore  in their  stead  we  use  sensible  measures  of
them.  For  from  the positions  and  distances  of things from  any body  con
sidered  as immovable,  we  define  all places ; and  then  with  respect  to such
places, we  estimate  all motions,  considering  bodies  as transferred  from  some

of those  places  into others.  And'so,  instead  of absolute  places and  motions,
we  use  relative  ones;  and  that without  any inconvenience  in common  af
fairs ; but  in philosophical  disquisitions,  we  ought  to  abstract  from  our
senses, and  consider  things  themselves,  distinct  from  what  are only sensible
measures  of them.  For  it may  be that  there  is no body  really at  rest,  to
which  the places and  motions  of others may  be referred.
   But  we may  distinguish  rest and  motion,  absolute  and  relative,  one from
the other by their  properties,  causes  and  effects.  It is a  property  of  rest,
that  bodies  really  at rest do  rest  in respect  to one another.  And  therefore
as it is possible,  that  in the remote  regions  of the  fixed  stars,  or perhaps
 far beyond  them,  there may  be some  body  absolutely  at rest ; but impossi
 ble to know,  from  the position  of bodies  to one  another  in  our  regions
whether  any  of these  do keep  the  same  position  to that remote  body;  it
follows  that  absolute  rest cannot  be determined  from  the position  of bodies
in our  regions.
   It is a property  of motion,  that  the  parts, which  retain  given  positions
 to their  wholes,  do partake  of the motions  of  those wholes.  For  all the
parts  of revolving  bodies  endeavour  to  recede  from  the  axis of motion  ;
and  the impetus  of bodies moving  forward,  arises from  the  joint impetus
of  all the parts.  Therefore,  if surrounding  bodies  are moved,  those  that
 are  relatively  at  rest within  them,  will partake  of  their motion.  Upon
 which  account,  the  true  and  absolute  motion  of  a body  cannot  be Jeter-

mined  by the translation  of  it from  those which  only seem  to rest ; for the
external  bodies  ought  not  only  to appear  at rest, but  to be really  at  rest.
For  otherwise,  all included  bodies,  beside  their  translation  from  near  the
surrounding  ones, partake  likewise  of their  true motions  ; and though  that
translation  were  not made  they would  not  be really at  rest, but  only seem
to be so.  For  the surrounding  bodies  stand  in  the  like  relation  to  the
surrounded  as the  exterior  part  of  a whole  does  to the  interior,  or  as the
shell  does  to  the  kernel ; but,  if the  shell moves,  the  kernel  will  also
move,  as being  part  of the whole,  without  any  removal  from  near  the  shell.
  A  property,  near  akin  to the preceding,  is this, that  if  a place  is moved,
whatever  is placed  therein  moves  along with   it ; and  therefore  a body,
which  is moved  from  a place  in motion,  partakes  also  of the motion  of  its
place.  Upon  which  account,  all motions,  from  places  in  motion,  are  no
other  than  parts  of  entire  and  absolute  motions  ; and  every  entire  motion
is composed  of  the motion  of the  body  out  of  its  first place, and  the
motion  of  this  place out  of  its place ; and  so  on, until we  come  to some
immovable  place, as in the before-mentioned  example  of the sailor.  Where
fore, entire  and  absolute  motions  can  be no  otherwise  determined  than  by
immovable  places  : and  for  that  reason  I did  before  refer  those  absolute
motions  to immovable  places, but  relative  ones  to movable  places. Now
no  other  places  are immovable  but  those  that, from  infinity  to infinity, do
all retain  the same  given  position  one  to another  ; and  upon  this account
must  ever  remain  unmoved  ; and  do thereby  constitute  immovable  space.
  The  causes  by which  true  and  relative  motions  are  distinguished,  one
from  the  other,  are  the  forces impressed  upon  bodies  to generate  motion.
True  motion  is neither  generated  nor  altered,  but by some  force  impressed
upon  the  body moved  : but  relative  motion  may  be generated  or  altered
without  any  force impressed  upon  the body.  For  it is sufficient  only  to
impress  some  force  on  other  bodies  with  which  the former  is compared,
that  by their  giving  way,  that  relation may  be changed,  in which  the  re
lative  rest  or motion  of  this other  body  did consist.  Again,  true motion
suffers always  some  change  from  any  force  impressed  upon  the moving
body  ; but  relative  motion  docs  not  necessarily  undergo  any  change  by such
forces.  For  if the same  forces  are likewise  impressed  on  those  other  bodies,
 with  which  the comparison  is made,  that  the  relative  position may  be pre
served,  then  that  condition  will  be preserved  in which  the relative  motion
consists. And  therefore  any  relative  motion  may  be changed when  the
 true motion  remains  unaltered,  and  the  relative may  be preserved when  the
 true  suffers some  change.  Upon  which  accounts;  true  motion  does  by no
 means  consist  in such  relations.
   The   effects whicli  distinguish  absolute  from  relative  motion  arc, the
 forces  of receding  from  the  axis  of circular motion.  For  there  are  no such
 forces  in  a circular  motion  purely  relative,  but  in a true  and  absolute  cir
 cular  motion.,  they  are  greater  or  less, according  t » the  quantity  of  the

| external bo | dies | ought not | only t | o appear | at rest, but | to be reall | y at rest. |
| For otherwis | e, al | l included | bodies, | beside t | heir transla | tion from | near the |
| surrounding | ones, | partake l | ikewise | of their | true motion | s ; and th | ough that |
| translation | were | not made | they wo | uld not | be really at | rest, but | only seem |
| to be so. F | or th | e surround | ing bo | dies sta | nd in the l | ike relati | on to the |
| surrounded | as th | e exterior | part o | f a whol | e does to th | e interior, | or as the |
| shell does | to th | e kernel ; | b ut, i | f the she | ll moves, t | he kernel | will also |
| move, as bei | ng par | t of the wh | ole, w | ithout a | ny removal | from near | the shell. |
| A propert | y, ne | ar akin to | the pr | eceding, | is this, that | if a place | is moved, |
| whatever i | s pla | ced therein | moves | along | with it ; a | nd therefor | e a body, |
| which is mo | ved | from a plac | e in m | otion, pa | rtakes also | of the moti | on of its |
| place. Upo | n whi | ch account | , all | motions, | from place | s in motio | n, are no |
| other than | parts | of entire a | nd abs | olute mot | ions ; and | every entir | e motion |
| is composed | of | the motio | n of t | he body | out of its | first place, | and the |
| motion of | this | place out o | f its | place ; a | nd so on, unt | il we come | to some |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| immovable | place, | as in the b | efore-m | entioned | example of | the sailor. | Where |
| fore, entire | and a | bsolute mot | ions c | an be no | otherwise | determined | than by |
| immovable | place | s : and fo | r that | reason I | did before | refer those | absolute |
| motions to | immov | able place | s, but | relative | ones to mov | able plac | es. Now |
| no other pla | ces a | re immovab | le but | those th | at, from in | finity to in | finity, do |
| all retain th | e sam | e given po | sition | one to a | nother ; and | upon thi | s account |
| must ever r | emain | unmoved | ; and | do thereb | y constitute | immovable | space. |
| The cause | s by | which tru | e and | relative | motions are | distingui | shed, one |
| from the ot | her, a | re the forc | es impr | essed u | pon bodies | to generat | e motion. |
| True motio | n is n | either gene | rated | nor alter | ed, but by s | ome force | impressed |
| upon the b | ody m | oved : but | relat | ive moti | on may be | generated | or altered |
| without any | forc | e impressed | upon | the bod | y. For it | is sufficien | t only to |
| impress som | e fo | rce on ot | her bod | ies with | which the | former is | compared, |
| that by the | ir gi | ving way, | that re | lation m | ay be change | d, in whic | h the re |
| lative rest | or mo | tion of th | is othe | r body d | id consist. | Again, tr | ue motion |
| suffers alwa | ys s | ome chang | e from | any fo | rce impress | ed upon th | e moving |
| body ; b ut | relati | ve motion | docs no | t necessa | rily undergo | any chang | e by such |
| forces. For | if t | he same fo | rces are | likewise | impressed o | n those oth | er bodies, |
| with which | the | comparison | is mad | e, that | the relative | position ma | y be pre |
| served, then | that | condition | will be | preserv | ed in which | the relati | ve motion |
| consists. A | nd | therefore a | ny rel | ative mot | ion may be | changed | when the |
| true motion | rema | ins unalter | ed, an | d the rel | ative may be | preserved | when the |
| true suffers | some | change. | Upon | which ac | counts; true | motion d | oes by no |
| means consi | st in | such relat | ions. |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

 motion.   If a vessel, hung: by & }ong  cord,  is so often  turned  ubout  that  the
 cord  is strongly  twisted,  then  filled with  water,  and  held  at  rest  together
 with  the water  ; after, by  the sudden  action  of another  force,  it is whirled
 about  the contrary  way,  and  while  the cord  is untwisting  itself, the  vessel
 continues  for some  time  in this motion  ; the surface  of the water  will  at
 first be plain,  as before  the  vessel began  to move  : but  the  vessel; by grad
 ually communicating   its motion  to the water,  will make  it begin  sensibly
^to revolve,  and  recede  by little and  little from  the middle,  and  ascend  to the
 sides of  the vessel, forming  itself  into  a concave  figure  (as I have  experi
 enced), and  the swifter  the motion  becomes,  the higher  will  the water  rise,
 till at  last, performing  its revolutions  in the same  times  with  the  vessel,
 it becomes  relatively  at rest in it.  This  ascent  of the water  shows  its en
 deavour  to recede  from  the  axis of  its motion  ; and  the  true  and  absolute
 circular  motion  of  the water,  which  is here  directly  contrary  to the  rela-
 tivej discovers  itself, and  may  be measured  by this endeavour.  At  first,
 when  the  relative  motion  of  the water  in the  vessel was  greatest,  it pro
 duced  no  endeavour  to recede  from  the axis ; the water  showed  no tendency
 to the circumference,  nor  any  ascent  towards  the  sides  of  the  vessel,  but
 remained  of  a plain  surface,  and  therefore  its true  circular  motion  had  not
 yet begun.  But  afterwards,  when  the relative  motion  of  the water  had
 decreased,  the  ascent  thereof  towards  the  sides of  the  vessel proved  its en
 deavour  to recede  from  the  axis ; and  this endeavour  showed  the  real  cir
 cular  motion  of  the water  perpetually  increasing,  till it had  acquired  its
 greatest  quantity, wh en  the water  rested  relatively  in  the  vessel.  And
 therefore  this endeavour  does  not depend  upon  any translation  of the water
 in respect  of  the ambient  bodies,  nor  can  true  circular  motion  be  defined
 by such  translation.  There  is only  one  real  circular  motion  of any  one
 revolving  body, corresponding  to only  one  power  of endeavouring  to recede
 from  its axis  of motion,  as  its proper  and  adequate  effect ; but  relative
 motions,  in one  and  the same  body,  are innumerable,  according  to the various
 relations  it bears  to external  bodies, and  like  other  relations,  arc altogether
 destitute  of any  real  effect, any  otherwise  than  they may  perhaps  par
 take  of  that one  only true  motion.  And  therefore  in their system  who
 suppose  that  our  heavens,  revolving  below  the  sphere  of  the  fixed  stars,
 carry  the planets  along with  them ; the several  parts  of those  heavens,  and
 the  planets, which  are  indeed  relatively  at  rest  in  their  heavens,  do yet
 really move.  For  they change  their  position  one  to another  (which  never
 happens  to bodies  truly at  rest), and  being  carried  together with  their
 heavens,  partake  of  their  motions,  and  as  parts  of  revolving  wholes,
 endeavour  to recede  from  the  axis  of their motions.
    Wherefore  relative  quantities  are not  the  quantities  themselves,  whose
 names  they  bear, but  those  sensible  measures  of them  (either accurate  cr
 inaccurate),  which  arc commonly  used  instead  of  the measured  quantities
 themselves.  And  if the meaning  of words   is to he determined  bv  their

| with the wat | er ; | after, by th | e sudden action o | f another for | ce, it | is whirled |
| about the con | trary | way, and | while the cord i | s untwisting | itself, | the vessel |
| continues for | som | e time in | this motion ; t he | surface of th | e wate | r will at |
| first be plain, | as b | efore the v | essel began to mo | ve : but the | vessel; | by grad |
| ually commun | icati | ng its mot | ion to the water, | will make i | t begin | sensibly |
| to revolve, an | d re | cede by littl | e and little from | the middle, a | nd asce | nd to the |
| sides of the | vessel | , forming | itself into a con | cave figure ( | as I hav | e experi |

| till at last, | perf | orming its | revolutions in the | same times | with | the vessel, |
| it becomes re | lativ | ely at rest | in it. This asce | nt of the wate | r sho | ws its en |
| deavour to re | cede | from the a | xis of its motion | ; and the t | rue and | absolute |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| circular moti | on | of the wate | r, which is here | directly contr | ary to | the rela- |
| tivej discovers | its | elf, and ma | y be measured | by this ende | avour. | At first, |
| when the rel | ative | motion of | the water in the | vessel was g | reatest | , it pro |
| duced no end | eavou | r to recede | from the axis ; | t he water sho | wed no | tendency |
| to the circum | feren | ce, nor any | ascent towards | the sides of | the v | essel, but |
| remained of | a pla | in surface, | and therefore its | true circular | motion | had not |
| yet begun. | But | afterwards, | when the relati | ve motion of | the w | ater had |
| decreased, the | asc | ent thereof | towards the side | s of the vesse | l prov | ed its en |
| deavour to re | cede | from the a | xis ; and this en | deavour show | ed th | e real cir |
| cular motion | of | the water | perpetually incre | asing, till it | had ac | quired its |
| greatest quan | tity, | wh en the | water rested re | latively in t | he ves | sel. And |
| therefore this | end | eavour does | not depend upon | any translat | ion of | the water |
| in respect of | the | ambient bo | dies, nor can true | circular mo | tion | be defined |
| by such tran | slati | on. There | is only one real | circular mot | ion o | f any one |
| revolving bod | y, c | orrespondin | g to only one po | wer of endeav | ouring | to recede |
| from its axi | s of | motion, a | s its proper and | adequate effe | ct ; b u | t relative |

| relations it b | ears | to external | bodies, and like | other relation | s, arc | altogether |
| destitute of | any | real effect, | any otherwise t | han they ma | y per | haps par |
| take of that | one | only true | motion. And t | herefore in t | heir sy | stem who |
| suppose that | our | heavens, re | volving below t | he sphere of | the f | ixed stars, |
| carry the pla | nets | along with | them ; the sever | al parts of th | ose hea | vens, and |
| the planets, | whic | h are ind | eed relatively at | rest in their | heaven | s, do yet |

use, then  by the names  time,  space,  place and  motion,  their measures   arv
properly  to be understood  ; and  the expression  will  be unusual,  and  purely
mathematical,  if the measured  quantities  themselves  are meant.  Upon
which  account,  they do  strain  the  sacred  writings, who  there  interpret
those words  for  the measured  quantities.  Nor  do  those  less  defile  the
purity  of mathematical  and  philosophical  truths, who  confound  real quan
tities themselves  with  their  relations  and  vulgar  measures.
   It  is indeed  a matter  of great  difficulty  to discover, and  effectually  to
distinguish,  the true  motions  of  particular  bodies  from  the apparent ; be
cause  the parts  of  that immovable  space,  in which  those motions  are  per
formed,  do by no  means  come  under  the  observation  of our  senses.  Yet
the  thing  is not  altogether  desperate :  for we  have  some  arguments  to
guide  us, partly from  the apparent  motions, which  are  the  differences  of
the  true  motions  ; partly from  the  forces, which  are  the causes  and  effects
of the  true motions.  For  instance,  if tAvo  globes, kept  at  a given  distance
one from  the  other by means  of  a cord  that  connects  them,  were  revolved
about  their common  centre  of gravity,  we  might,  from  the tension  of  the
cord, discover  the endeavour  of  the globes  to recede  from  the  axis of  their
motion,  and  from  thence  we  might  compute  the quantity  of  their  circular
motions.  And  then  if any  equal  forces  should  be impressed  at once  on the
alternate  faces  of the globes  to augment  or diminish  their  circular  motions,
from  the  increase  or decr»  ase of the  tensicn  of  1 le  cord, we  might  infer
the increment  or decrement  of  their  motions  : and  thence  would  be found
on what  faces  those  forces ought  to be impressed,  that  the motions  of  the
globes might  be most  augmented  ; that  is, we  might  discover  their  hinder-
most  faces,  or those which,  in  the  circular  motion,  do follow.  But  the
faces which  follow  being  known,  and  consequently  the opposite  ones  that
precede, we  should  likewise know  the determination  of their motions.  And
thus  we  might  find both  the quantity  and  the determination  of  this circu
lar motion,  even  in an immense  vacuum,  where  there  was  nothing  external
or sensible  with  which  the globes  could  be compared.  But  now,  if in that
space  some  remote  bodies  were  placed  that  kept always  a given  position
one  to  another,  as  the  fixed  stars  do  in our  regions,  we  could  not  indeed
determine  from  the  relative  translation  of the  globes among  those  bodies,
whether  the motion  did  belong  to  the globes  or  to the bodies.  But  if we
observed  the  cord, and  found  that  its tension  was  that  very  tension  which
the motions  of  the globes  required,  we  might  conclude  the motion  to be in
the  globes, and  the  bodies  to be  at  rest  ; and  then,  lastly, from  the  trans
lation  of  the globes among  the  bodies,  we  should  find the determination  oi
their motions.  But  how  we  are  to  collect  the  true  motions  from  their
causes,  effects, and  apparent  differences  ; and,  vice  versa, how  from  the mo
tions,  either  true  or  apparent,  we  may  come  to the knowledge  of  theii
causes  and  effects, shall  be explained  more  at large  in the following   tra<;t

         AXIOMS,  OR LAWS  OF MOTION.


                      LAW    I.

 Hvery  body perseveres  in  its state  of rest,  or of uniform  motion  in a ri^ht
   line, unless  it is compelled  to change  that  state by forces impressed
   thereon.

   PROJECTILES  persevere  in their motions,  so far  as they  are not  retarded
by the resistance  of the  air, or impelled  downwards  by the  force  of gravity
A  top, whose  parts by their  cohesion  are  perpetually drawn  aside  from
rectilinear  motions,  does  not  cease  its rotation,  otherwise  than  as  it is re
tarded  by the air.  The  greater  bodies  of  the planets  and  comets,  meeting
with  less resistance  in more  free  spaces,  preserve  then  jDotions  both  pro
gressive  and  circular  for  a much  longer  time.

                         LAW     II.

 The  alteration  of motion  is ever proportional  to the motive  force  imp  reus
   ed ; and  is made  in  the direction  of  the right  line  in. which  that force
   is impressed.
   If any  force generates  a motion,  a double  force  will generate  double  the
motion,  a triple force  triple  the motion, whether  that  force  be  impressed
altogether  and  at once,  or gradually  and  successively.  And  this motion
(being always  directed  the same  way  with  the generating  force),  if the body
moved  before,  is added  to or subducted  from  the former  motion,  according
as they directly  conspire with  or  are  directly contrary  to  each  other ; or
obliquely  joined, when  they  are  oblique,  so  as  to produce  a new  motion
compounded  from  the determination  of both.

                     LAW    III.

To  every  action  there  is always  opposed  an  equal  reaction  :  or the mu
   tual  actions  of two  bodies  upon  each  other  are  always  equal, and  di
   rected  to contrary  parts.
  Whatever  draws  or presses  another  is as much  drawn   or pressed  by that
other.  If you  press  a stone  with  your  finger, the  finger  is also pressed by
the stone.  If  a horse  draws  a stone  tied  to  a rope,  the horse  (if I may   so
say) will  be equally drawn  back  towards  the stone:  for  the distended  rope,
by the same  endeavour  to  relax  or  unbend  itself, will draw  the  horse  as
much  towards  the  stone,  as  it does  the stone  towards  the horse, and  will
obstruct  the progress  of  the  one  as much  as it advances  that of  the  other.

84              THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES

If a body impinge  upon  another,  and by  its force change  the motion  of  (It*
other, that body  also (because  of the equality  of  the mutual  pressure)  will
undergo  an  equal  change,  in  its own  motion,  towards  the  contrary  part.
The  changes  made  by  these  actions  are  equal, not  in the velocities  but  in
the motions  of bodies ; that  is to say,  if the bodies  are  not hindered  by any
other impediments.  For,  because  the motions  are  equally  changed,  the
changes  of the  velocities made  towards  contrary  parts  are  reciprocally  pro
portional  to the bodies.  This  law  takes  place  also  in attractions,  as will
be proved  in the next  scholium.

                  COROLLARY    I.

A body  by two forces  conjoined  will  describe  the diagonal  of  a parallelo
   gram,  in the same  time  that  it wovld  describe  the sides, by those forces
   apart.
    If a body  in  a given  time, by the  force M  impressed
apart  in the place A, should  with  an  uniform  motion     /
 be carried  from  A  to B  ; and  by the  force N  impressed

apart  in  the same  place, should  be carried  from  A  to c              ~\)
 C  ; complete  the parallelogram ABCD,   and, by both  forces  acting  together,
 it will  in  the same  time  be  carried  in  the diagonal  from  A  to  D.   For
 since  the  force N  acts  in the  direction  of the  line AC,  parallel  to BD,  this
 force  (by the second  law)  will  not  at  all alter  the velocity generated  by the
 other  force M,  by which  the body  is carried  towards  the  line  BD.    The
 body  therefore  will  arrive  at  the  line BD   in the same  time, whether  the
 rorce N  be impressed  or not  ; and  therefore  at the end  of  that  time  it will
 he found  somewhere  in the  line  BD.    By  the same  argument,  at  the  end
 of the same  time  it  AY ill be found  somewhere  in the line CD.    Therefore  it
 will  be found  in the point D, where  both  lines  meet.    But  it will move  in
 ;i right  line from  A  to D, by Law   I.

                  COROLLARY    II.

 And  hence  is explained  the composition  of any  one  direct force AD,  out
    of any  two  oblique  forces AC  and CD  ; and,  on  the contrary,  the  re
   solution  of any  one  direct  force AD  into  two  oblique  forces AC  and
  CD  : which  composition  and  resolution  are abundantly  confirmed  from,
   mechanics.

   As  if the unequal  radii OM  and ON  drawn  from  the centre  O  of any
 wheel,  should  sustain  the weights  A  and  P by  the cords MA  and NP  ; and
 the forces  of those  weights  to move  the wheel  were  required.  Through  the
 rentre O  draw  the  right  line KOL,  meeting  the  cords  perpendicularly  in
 A  and L;  and  from  the centre  O, with OL   the greater  of  the  distances

| the motions | of b | odies ; t hat | is to say, if the | bodi | es are not h | indered | by any |

OK   arid OL,  describe  a circle, meeting  the  cord

MA   in D  : and  drawing  OD,  make  AC  paral- "^
lei and DC  perpendicular  thereto.  Now,   it
being  indifferent  whether  the  points K, L, D, of
the cords  be lixed  to the plane  of  the wheel  or
not,  the  weights  will  have  the  same   effect
whether  they  are  suspended  from  the points K
and  L, or from  D  and L.  Let  the whole  force
of  the weight  A  be represented  by the  line AD,
and  let it be  resolved  into  the  forces AC  and

CD  ; of which  the  force AC, drawing  the radius
OD  directly from  the  centre,  will  have  no  effect  to move  the wheel  : but
the other  force DC,  drawing  the radius DO  perpendicularly,  will have  the
same  effect  as  if it drew  perpendicularly  the radius OL  equal  to OD  ; that
is, it w ill have  the same  effect  as the weight  P,  if that weight  is to  the
weight  A  as the  force DC   is to the  force DA  ; that  is (because  of the sim
ilar triangles ADC,  DOK),  as OK   to OD  or OL.  Therefore  the weights A
and  P, which  are  reciprocally  as the  radii OK  and OL  that  lie in the same
right  line, will be equipollent,  and  so remain  in equilibrio  ; which  is the  well
known  property  of the  balance,  the  lever, and  the wheel.  If either weight  is
greater  than  in this  ratio,  its force  to move  the wheel  will be  so much  greater.
   If the  weight  p,  equal  to  the  weight  P,  is partly suspended  by the
cord  NJO, partly sustained  by the  oblique  plane pG ; draw  p}i, NH,  the
former  perpendicular  to  the  horizon,  the  latter  to the plane pG  ; and  if
the force  of the  weight p tending  downwards   is represented  by the  line
/?H,  it may  be resolved  into  the  forces  joN, HN.   If  there was  any  plane
/?Q, perpendicular  to the  cord  y?N, cutting  the  other  plane pG  in a line
parallel  to  the  horizon,  and  the  weight p  was  supported  only by  those
planes pQ, pG,  it would  press  those  planes  perpendicularly  with  the forces
pN, HN;   to wit, the plane  joQ, with  the  force joN, and  the  plane pG  with
the  force HN.  And  therefore  if the  plane pQ  was  taken  away,  so thnt
the weight  might  stretch  the  cord, because  the  cord,  now  sustaining  the
weight,  supplies  the place  of the plane  that  was  removed,  it will  be strained
by the same  force joN  which  pressed upon  the plane before.  Therefore,
 the tension  of this oblique  cord joN  will be  to that  of the  other  perpendic
ular  cord PN   as jt?N to joH.  And  therefore  if  the weight p  is to the
weight  A  in  a ratio compounded  of the reciprocal  ratio  of the  least distances
 of the  cords PN, AM,  from  the centre  of the wheel,  and  of the direct  ratio  of
pH  tojoN,  the weights  will have  the same  effect towards  moving  the wheel,
and  will  therefore  sustain  each  other  : as any  one may  find by experiment.
   But  the weight  p  pressing  upon  those two  oblique  planes, may  be  con
 sidered  as  a wedge  between  the two  internal  surfaces  of a body  split by it;
 and  hence  tlif  ft IV.P*  of th^   v, ^dge and  the mallet  may  be determined;  foi

a mallet,  is impelled  in  the  direction  of  the  line joH  towards  both  the
planes,  as joN  to pH  ; and  to the  force  with which  it presses  the other
plane pG,  as joN  to NH.  And  thus  the force  of the screw  may  be deduced
from  a like resolution  of  forces ; it being  no  other  than  a wedge  impelled
with  the  force  of a lever.  Therefore  the  use  of this Corollary  spreads  far
and  wide, and  by that  diffusive  extent  the  truth  thereof  is farther  con
firmed.  For  on  what  has  been  said depends  the whole  doctrine  of mechan
ics variously  demonstrated  by different authors.  For  from  hence  are  easily
deduced  the  forces  of machines,  which  are compounded  of  wheels,  pullics,
levers,  cords, and  weights,  ascending  directly  or obliquely,  and  other mechan
ical powers  ; as also  the force  of the tendons  to move  the bones  of animals.

                 COROLLARY    III.

The  (/uaittity  of motion,  which  is collected  by taking  the sum  of the mo
   tions  directed  towards  the same  parts, and  the difference  of those  that
   are  directed  to contrary  parts,  suffers  no  change  from  the action  oj
   bodies among  themselves.

   For  action  and  its opposite  re-action  are  equal, by Law   III, and  there
fore, by Law  II, they produce  in the motions  equal changes  towards  oppo
site parts.  Therefore  if  the motions  are directed  towards  the same  parts.
whatever  is added  to the motion  of  the  preceding  body  will  be subducted
from  the motion  of  that which  follows  ; so that  the sum  will  be the same
as before.  If the  bodies  meet,  with  contrary  motions,  there  will  be an
equal  deduction  from  the motions  of both  ; and  therefore  the  difference  of
the motions  directed  towards  opposite  parts  will remain  the  same.
  Thus  if  a spherical  body A  with  two  parts  of  velocity  is triple  of  a
spherical  body  B which  follows  in  the same  right  line with  ten  parts  of
velocity,  the motion  of A  will be  to  that  of B  as  6 to 10.  Suppose,
then,  their motions  to be of  6 parts and  of  10  parts, and  the sum  will  be
16 parts.  Therefore,  upon  the meeting  of the bodies,  if A  acquire  3, 4,
or 5 parts  of motion,  B  will  lose  as many  ; and  therefore  after  reflexion
A  will  proceed  With  9, 10, or  11  parts, and  B  with  7, 6, or 5 parts;  the
sum  remaining  always  of  16  parts  as before.  If  the body A  acquire  9,
10, 11, or 12  parts  of motion,  and  therefore  after meeting  proceed  with
15, 16, 17, or  18  parts,  the body  B, losing  so many  parts  as A  has  got,
will  either  proceed  with  1 part, having  lost  9, or stop and remain  at  rest,
as having  lost  its whole  progressive  motion  of 10  parts  ; or  it will go back
with  1 part, having  not  only  lost  its whole  motion,  but  (if 1 may  so  say)
one  part more;  or  it will go back  with  2 parts, because  a progressive  mo
tion  of 12 parts  is taken  off. And  so the sums  of  the  Conspiring  motions

 [S —  2, will always  be  equal  to 16  parts,  as they were  before  tie meeting
and  reflexion  of  the bodies.  But,  the  motions  being known  with  whicli
the bodies  proceed  after  reflexion,  the velocity  of either  will  be also known,
by taking  the velocity  after  to the velocity  before  reflexion,  as the motion
after  is to the motion  before.  As  in the  last  case, where  the motion  of tho
body A  was  of 0  parts  before  reflexion  and  of IS  parts  after, and  the
velocity  was  of 2 parts before  reflexion,  the velocity  thereof  after  reflexion
will  be found  to be  of 6 parts ; by saying,  as the  0 parts of motion  before
to 18 parts  after,  so  are 2 parts  of velocity  before  reflexion  to  (5 parts  after.
  But  if the  bodies  are  cither  not  spherical,  or, moving  in different  right

lines, impinge  obliquely  one  upon  the  other, and  their mot'ons  after  re
flexion  are  required,  in  those  cases  we  are  first to determine  the position
of the plane  that  touches  the concurring  bodies  in the point  of concourse      ,
then  the motion  of each body  (by Corol.  II) is to be resolved  into two,  one
perpendicular  to that  plane, and  the other  parallel  to it.  This  done,  be
cause  the bodies  act upon  each  other  in the  direction  of a line perpendicu
lar  to this plane,  the parallel motions  are  to be  retained  the same  after
reflexion  as  before ; and  to the  perpendicular  motions  we  are  to assign
equal  changes  towards  the  contrary  parts ; in such manner  that  the sum
of the conspiring  and  the  difference  of  the contrary  motions  may  remain
the same  as before.  From  such  kind  of  reflexions  also sometimes  arise
the  circular  motions  of  bodies  about  their own  centres.  But  these  are
cases  which  I do  not  consider  in what  follows  ; and  it would  be too tedious
to demonstrate  every  particular  that  relates  to this  subject.

                 COROLLARY    IV.

The common   centre  of gravity  of two  or more  bodies  does  not  alter  its
   state  of 'motion  or  rest by the actions  of the bodies among  themselves  ;
  and  therefore  the common   centre  of gravity  of all bodies  acting  upon
  each  other  (excluding  outward  actions  and  impediments)  is either  at
   rest,  or moves  uniformly  in  a right  line.
  For  if two  points  proceed  with  an  uniform  motion  in right  lines, and
their  distance  be divided  in  a given  ratio,  the dividing  point  will  be either
at  rest,  or proceed  uniformly  in  a right line.  This  is demonstrated  here
after  in Lem.  XXIII  and  its Corol., when  the points  are moved  in the same
plane ; and  by a  like way  of  arguing,  it may  be demonstrated  when  the
points  are  not moved  in  the same  plane.  Therefore  if any number  of
Kdies  move  uniformly  in right  lines, the common   centre  of gravity  of any
two  of them  is either  at rest,  or proceeds  uniformly  in  a right  line ; because
the line which  connects  the centres  of those  two  bodies  so moving   is divided  at
that common  centre  in  a given ratio.  In  like manner  the common   centre
of those  two  and  that  of a third body  will be either  at rest  or moving  uni

common  centre  of the two  bodies, and  the centre  of  this  last, is divided  in
a given ratio.  In  like manner  the common   centre  of these  three, and  of  a
fourth  body,  is either  at  rest, or moves  uniformly  in  a right  line ; because
the distance  between  the common  centre  of the  three  bodies, and  the centre
of the fourth  is there  also divided  in  a given  ratio, and  so  on m  itifinitum.
Therefore,  in  a system  of bodies  where  there  is neither  any  mutual  action
among  themselves,  nor  any foreign  force impressed  upon  them  from  without,
and  which  consequently  move  uniformly  in right  lines, the common  centre  of
gravity  of them  all is either  at rest  or moves  uniformly  forward  in  a right  line.
   Moreover,  in  a system  of two  bodies  mutually  acting upon  each  other,
since  the  distances  between  their  centres  and  the common  centre  of gravity
of both  are  reciprocally  as the  bodies,  the  relative  motions  of  those  bodies,
whether  of approaching  to  or of receding  from  that  centre,  will  be  equal
among  themselves.  Therefore  since  the changes  which  happen  to motions
are  equal  and  directed  to contrary  parts, the common   centre  of those  bodies,
by their mutual  action  between  themselves,  is neither  promoted  nor  re
tarded,  nor  suffers  any  change  as to its state  of motion  or rest.  But  in  a
system  of several  bodies, because  the common  centre  of gravity  of any  two
acting mutually  upon  each  other  suffers  no change  in  its state by that  ac
 tion  : and much   less the common   centre  of gravity  of the others  with  which
 that  action  does  not intervene  ; but  the distance  between  those  two  centres
 is divided  by the common  centre  of gravity  of  all the bodies  into  parts  re
ciprocally  proportional  to the  total sums  of those  bodies  whose  centres  they
 are  : and  therefore  while  those  two  centres  retain  their  state  of motion  or
 rest, xhe common  centre  of all does  also retain  its state : it is manifest  that
 the common  centre  of all never  suffers  any  change  in the state  of  its mo
 tion  or  rest from  the  actions  of any  two  bodies between  themselves.  But
 in such  & system  all the  actions  of the bodies among  themselves  either hap
pen  between  two  bodies,  or  are composed  of  actions  interchanged  between
some  two  bodies ; and  therefore  they do never  produce  any  alteration  in
 the comrrv  n centre  of alias  to  its state  of motion  or  rest.  Wherefore
 tiince that  centre, when  the  bodies  do not  act mutually  one  upon  another,
 Oilier  is nt  rest  or moves  uniformly  forward  in some  right  line, it will,

 liiv,, unless  it is forced  out  of this state by the  action  of some  power  im-
 prev^-d from  without  upon  the whole  system.  And  therefore  the same  law
 take*1  place  in  a system  consisting  of many  bodies  as in one  single body,
 with  wsgard  to their persevering  in their  state  of motion  or  of rest.  For
 the  pi \\jressive  motion,  whether  of one  single body,  or of  a whole  system  of
 bodies  us always  to be estimated  from  the motion  of the centre  of gravity.

   in  a right  line without  any  circular  motion.
  For  the differences  of the motions  tending  towards  the same  parts, and
the sums  of those  that  tend  towards  contrary  parts,  are,  at  first (by sup
position),  in both  cases  the same  ; and  it is from  those sums  and  differences
that  the  collisions  and  impulses  do  arise with  which  the bodies  mutually
impinge  one  upon  another.  Wherefore  (by Law   II), the  effects of  those
collisions  will  be equal  in both  cases  ; and  therefore  the mutual  motions
of  the  bodies among  themselves  in the  one  case  will  remain  equal  to the
mutual  motions  of  the  bodies among  themselves  in the other.  A  clear
proof  of which  we  have  from  the experiment  of  a ship  ; where  all motions
happen  after  the same  manner,  whether  the  ship  is at  rest, or  is carried
uniformly  forwards  in a right  line.

                 COROLLARY    VI.

If bodies, any  how  moved  among  themselves,  are urged  in  the  direct-ton
   of parallel  lines by equal  accelerative  forces,  they will  all continue  to
   move  among  themselves,  after  the same  manner  as  if they had  been
  urged  by no  such  forces.
   For  these  forces acting  equally  (with  respect  to  the  quantities  of  the
DO dies  to be moved),  and  in the direction  of parallel  lines, will  (by Law  II)
move  all the bodies  equally  (as to velocity),  and  therefore  will never  pro
duce  any change  in the positions  or motions  of the bodies among  themselves.

                     SCHOLIUM.

   Hitherto  I have  laid down  such  principles  as have  been  received  by math
ematicians,  and  are confirmed  by abundance  of experiments.  By  the  first
two  Laws  and  the  first two  Corollaries,  Galileo  discovered  that  the  de
scent  of bodies  observed  the duplicate  ratio  of the  time, and  that  the mo
tion  of  projectiles was  in  the  curve  of  a parabola;  experience  agreeing
with  both,  unless  so  far  as  these motions  are  a little retarded  by the  re
sistance  of the  air. When  a body  is falling, the uniform  force  of  its
gravity  acting  equally,  impresses,  in equal  particles  of  time,  equal  forces
upon  that  body, and  therefore  generates  equal  velocities;  and  in the whole
time  impresses  a whole  force, and  generates  a whole  velocity  proportional
to the time.  And  the  spaces  described  in proportional  times  are  as  the
velocities  and  the  times  conjunctly  ; that  is, in a duplicate  ratio  of  the
times.  And  when  a body  is thrown  upwards,  its uniform  gravity  im
presses  forces  and  takes  off velocities  proportional  to the times  ; and  the
times  of ascending  to the greatest  heights  are  as the  velocities  to be taken
 off, and  those  heights  are  as the  velocities  and  the  times  conjunetly,  or  ir,
 the duplicate  ratio  of  the velocities.  And  if a body  be projected  in any
 direction,  the motion  arising  from  its projection  jS compounded  with  the

| in a right lin | e without a | ny circular | motion. |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| For the differ | ences of th | e motions te | nding toward | s the same | parts, and |
| the sums of tho | se that te | nd towards c | ontrary parts | , are, at f | irst (by sup |
| position), in both | cases the | same ; and it | is from thos | e sums and | differences |
| that the collisi | ons and imp | ulses do ari | se with whic | h the bodi | es mutually |
| impinge one up | on another | . Wherefore | (by Law I | I), the effe | cts of those |
| collisions will b | e equal in | both cases ; | and therefor | e the mutu | al motions |
| of the bodies a | mong thems | elves in the | one case wil | l remain | equal to the |
| mutual motions | of the bo | dies among | themselves | in the othe | r. A clear |
| proof of which w | e have fro | m the experi | ment of a sh | ip ; where | all motions |
| happen after th | e same ma | nner, whethe | r the ship | is at rest, | or is carried |
| uniformly forwar | ds in a rig | ht line. |  |  |  |

| If bodies, any | how moved | among them | selves, are | urged in t | he direct-ton |
| of parallel li | nes by equa | l accelerative | forces, the | y will all | continue to |
| move among | themselves, | after the sa | me manner | as if the | y had been |
| urged by no s | uch forces. |  |  |  |  |
| For these forc | es acting e | qually (with | respect to | the quanti | ties of the |

motion  arising from  its gravity.  As  if the body A  by  its motion  of pio-
jection  alone  could  describe  in  a given  time  the  right  line
AB,  and  with  its motion  of falling  alone  could  describe  in
the same  time  the  altitude  AC  ; complete  the  paralello-
gram ABDC,  and  the body  by that compounded  motion
 will at the  end  of the  time  be found  in the place D  ; and
the curve  line AED,  which  that  body  describes,  will  be  a
parabola,  to which  the  right  line AB  will  be  a tangent  in
A  ; and  whose  ordinate BD   will be as the square  of the  line AB.   On  the
same  Laws  and  Corollaries  depend  those  things which  have  been demon
strated  concerning  the  times  of  the vibration  of pendulums,  and  are  con
firmed  by the daily experiments  of pendulum  clocks.  By  the  same,  to
gether with  the third  Law,  Sir Christ.  Wren,  Dr.  Wallis,  and  Mr. Huv-
gens,  the greatest  geometers  of our  times,  did severally  determine  the rules
of  the  congress  and  reflexion  of hard  bodies,  and  much  about  the same
time communicated  their  discoveries  to the Royal  Society,  exactly agreeing
among  themselves  as to those  rules.  Dr.  Wallis,  indeed,  was  something
more  early  in the publication  ; then  followed  Sir Christopher  Wren,  and,
lastly, Mr. Huygens.  But  Sir Christopher  Wren  confirmed  the  truth  of
the thing  before  the Royal  Society  by the experiment  of pendulums,  which
Mr.  Mariottc  soon  after thought  fit to explain  in a treatise  entirely upon
that subject.  But  to bring  this experiment  to an  accurate  agreement  with
the  theory,  we  are  to have  a due  regard  as well  to the resistance  of the  air
as  to  the  clastic  force  of  the concurrin    bodies.   Let  the spherical  bodies
A, B  be suspended  by the  parallel  and     CD          F    II
equal  strings AC,  Bl), from  the  centres
C, D.  About  these  centres, with  those
intervals,  describe  the semicircles EAF,
GBH,  bisected  by  the  radii CA,  DB.
Bring  the body A  to any  point R  of the
arc EAF,  and  (withdrawing  the  body
 B)  let  it go from  thence,  and  after  one  oscillation  suppose  it to return  to
 the point  V  : then RV  will  be the retardation  arising from  the  resistance
 of  the  air.  Of  this RV   let ST  be a fourth  part, situated  in the  middle.
 to wit,  so  as RS  and TV  may  be equal, and RS  may  be  to ST  as 3 to 2
 then  will ST  represent  very  nearly  the  retardation  during  the descent
 from  S  to A.  Restore  the body  B  to  its place:  and,  supjx sing  the body
 A  to be  let fall from  the point  S, the velocity  thereof  in the  place  of  re
 flexion  A, without  sensible  error,  will  be  the same  as  if it had  descended
 m   vacit.o from  the point T.  Upon  which  account  this velocity may  be
 represented  by the chord  of  the  arc TA.  For  it is a proposition  well
 known  to geometers,  that  the velocity  of  a pendulous  body  in the  loAvest
 point  is as the chord  of  the  arc which  it has described  in its descent.  Aftci

reflexion,  suppose  the body A  comes  to the  place  s, and  the body B  to the
place k.  Withdraw   the body  B, and  find the  place  v, from  which  if the
body  A, being  let go, should  after  one  oscillation  return  to the place  r, st
may  be a fourth  part of  rv.  so placed  in the middle  thereof  as to leave  is
equal  to  tv, and  let the chord  of the  arc  tA  represent  the velocity which
the body A  had  in the place A  immediately  after reflexion.  For  t will  be
the  true  and  correct  place  to which  the body A  should  have  ascended,  if
the  resistance  of  the  air had  been  taken  off.  In  the  s.ime way  we  are  to
correct  the  place k  to which  the body B  ascends, by finding  the place  I to
which  it should  have  ascended  in vacuo.  And  thus  everything  may  be
subjected  to experiment,  in the same  manner  as if we  were  really placed
in vacuo.  These  things  being  done, we  are  to take  the product  (if I may
so say) of  the body  A, by the chord  of the  arc TA  (which  represents  its
velocity),  that  we may  have  its motion  in  the  place A  immediately  before
reflexion  ; and  then  by the chord  of  the  arc  /A, that we  may  have  its mo
tion  in  the  place A immediately  after  reflexion.  And   so we  are  to take
the product  of the  body  B by  the chord  of the  arc  B/, that  we  may  have
the motion  of the same  immediately  after reflexion.  And  in like manner,
when  two  bodies  are  let go together  from  different  places, we  are  to find
the motion  of  each,  as well  before  as  after reflexion;  and  then  we  may
compare  the motions  between  themselves,  and  collect  the  effects of  the  re
flexion.  Thus  trying  the  thing with  pendulums  of ten  feet, in unequal
as well  as equal  bodies, and making  the bodies  to concur  after  a  descent
through  large  spaces,  as  of  8, 12, or 16  feet, I found  always,  without  an
error  of 3  inches,  that when  the  bodies  concurred  together  directly, equal
changes  towards  the  contrary  parts were  produced  in their  motions,  and,
of consequence,  that  the  action  and  reaction  were  always  equal.  As  if the
body A impinged  upon  the  body B  at  rest with  9 parts  of motion,  and
losing  7, proceeded  after  reflexion with  2, the body  B  was  carried  back
wards  with  those  7 parts.  If the  bodies  concurred  with  contrary  motions,
A  with  twelve  parts  of motion,  and  B  with  six, then  if A  receded  with  J4,
B  receded  with  8 ; to wit, with  a deduction  of  14  parts  of motion  on
each side.  For  from  the motion  of A subducting  twelve  parts, nothing
will remain ; but subducting  2 parts more,  a motion  will  be generated  of
2 parts towards  the contrary way  ; and  so, from  the motion  of the  body
B  of 6 parts, subducting  14  parts,  a motion  is generated  of 8 parts towards
the contrary way.  But  if the  bodies  were  made  both  to move  towards  the
same  way,  A, the  swifter, with  14  parts  of motion,  B, the  slower, with  5,
and  after  reflexion  A  went  on  with  5, B  likewise  went  on with  14  parts ;
9 parts being  transferred  from  A  to B.  And  so in other  cases.  By  the
congress  and  collision  of bodies,  the quantity  of motion,  collected  from  the
sum  of  the motions  directed  towards  the same  way,  or from  the  difference,
of  those  that were  directed  towards  contrary  ways,  was  never  changed.
For  the  error  of  an  inch  or two  in measures  may  be easily ascribed  to tht

| which it | should hav | e ascended in | vacuo. | And thus e | verythin | g may be |
| subjected | to experime | nt, in the sam | e manner | as if we w | ere real | ly placed |

difficulty of executing  everything  with  accuracy.  It was  not  easy  to let
go the two pendulums  so exactly  together  that  the  bodies  should  impinge
one  upon  the  other  in the lowermost  place AB  ; nor  to mark  the  places  s,
and  ky to which  the bodies  ascended  after congress.  Nay,  and  some  errors,
too, might  have  happened  from  the unequal  density  of the parts  of the pen
dulous  bodies  themselves,  and  from  the  irregularity  of the  texture  pro
ceeding  from  other  causes.
  But  to prevent  an  objection  that may  perhaps  be alledged  against  the
rule, for  the proof  of which  this experiment  was  made,  as  if  this  rule  did
suppose  that  the  bodies  were  either  absolutely  hard,  or  at least perfectly
elastic (whereas  no  such  bodies  are  to be found  in nature),  1 must  add.  that
the experiments  we  have  been  describing,  by no  means  depending  upon
that  quality  of hardness,  do succeed  as well  in soft  as in hard  bodies.  For
if the  rule  is to be  tried  in bodies  not  perfectly  hard,  we  are  only  to di
minish  the  reflexion  in such  a certain  proportion  as  the  quantity  of  the
elastic  force requires.  By  the theory  of Wren  and  Huygens,  bodies  abso
lutely hard  return  one  from  another  with  the  same  velocity  with  which
they meet.  But  this may  be affirmed  with  more  certainty  of bodies  per
fectly elastic.  In bodies  imperfectly  elastic  the velocity  of the return  is to
be diminished  together  with  the  elastic  force ; because  that  force  (except
when  the parts  of bodies  are bruised  by their  congress,  or  suffer some  such
extension  as happens  under  the strokes  of a hammer)   is (as far as I can  per
ceive)  certain  and  determined,  and  makes  the bodies  to return  one from
the  other  with  a relative  velocity, which  is in  a given  ratio  to that  relative
velocity  with which  they met.  This  I tried  in  balls  of  wool, made  up
tightly, and  strongly compressed.  For,  first, by letting go  the pendulous
bodies, and measuring  their  reflexion,  I determined  the  quantity  of  their
elastic  force ; and  then, according  to  this  force, estimated  the  reflexions
that ought  to happen  in other  cases  of congress.  And  with  this computa
tion  other  experiments  made  afterwards  did accordingly  agree ; the  balls
always  receding  one from  the  other  with  a relative  velocity, which  was  to
the  relative  velocity  with  which  they met  as about  5 to 9.  Balls  of  steel
returned  with  almost  the same  velocity  : those  of cork  with  a velocity some-^
thing  less ; but  in  balls  of  glass  the  proportion  was  as about  15  to  16.
And  thus  the  third Law,  so far  as  it regards  percussions  and  reflexions,  is
proved  by  a theory  exactly  agreeing  with  experience.
   In attractions,  I briefly demonstrate  the  thing  after  this manner.  Sup
pose  an  obstacle  is interposed  to hinder  the congress  of any  two  bodies  A.
B, mutually  attracting  one  the  other  : then  if either  body,  as A,  is more
attracted  towards  the  other body  B, than  that  other body B  is towards  the
first body  A, the  obstacle  will  be more  strongly  urged  by the  pressure  of
the body A  than  by the  pressure  of  the  body B, and  therefore  will  not
remain  in equilibrio  : but  the stronger  pressure  will prevail, and  will make
the system  of  the two  bodies,  together  with  the  obstacle,  to move  directly

| one upon th | e other in the | lowermost place AB | ; nor to mark the | places s, |
| and ky to wh | ich the bodies | ascended after cong | ress. Nay, and so | me errors, |
| too, might h | ave happened | from the unequal den | sity of the parts of | the pen |
| dulous bodie | s themselves, | and from the irregu | larity of the tex | ture pro |
| ceeding fro | m other causes. |  |  |  |
| But to pr | event an obje | ction that may perh | aps be alledged ag | ainst the |
| rule, for the | proof of whic | h this experiment wa | s made, as if thi | s rule did |
| suppose tha | t the bodies | were either absolutel | y hard, or at least | perfectly |
| elastic (wher | eas no such b | odies are to be found | in nature), 1 must | add. that |
| the experim | ents we have | been describing, by | no means depend | ing upon |
| that quality | of hardness, | do succeed as well in | soft as in hard bod | ies. For |
| if the rule | is to be trie | d in bodies not perfec | tly hard, we are o | nly to di |
| minish the | reflexion in su | ch a certain proport | ion as the quanti | ty of the |
| elastic force | requires. By | the theory of Wren | and Huygens, bo | dies abso |
| lutely hard | return one f | rom another with th | e same velocity w | ith which |
| they meet. | But this may | be affirmed with mo | re certainty of b | odies per |
| fectly elast | ic. In bodies | imperfectly elastic th | e velocity of the r | eturn is to |
| be diminish | ed together wi | th the elastic force | ; b ecause that for | ce (except |
| when the p | arts of bodies | are bruised by their | congress, or suffer | some such |
| extension a | s happens unde | r the strokes of a ha | mmer) is (as far as | I c an per |
| ceive) certa | in and deter | mined, and makes t | he bodies to return | one from |
| the other wi | th a relative v | elocity, which is in a | given ratio to tha | t relative |
| velocity wit | h which they | met. This I tried | in balls of wool, | made up |
| tightly, and | strongly com | pressed. For, first, | by letting go the | pendulous |
| bodies, and | measuring the | ir reflexion, I deter | mined the quantity | of their |
| elastic force | ; and then, | according to this fo | rce, estimated the | reflexions |
| that ought | to happen in | other cases of congres | s. And with this | computa |
| tion other | experiments m | ade afterwards did | accordingly agree ; | the balls |
| always rece | ding one from | the other with a rel | ative velocity, whi | ch was to |
| the relative | velocity with | which they met as a | bout 5 to 9. Ball | s of steel |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| returned wi | th almost the | same velocity : those | of cork with a veloc | ity some-^ |
| thing less ; | but in balls | of glass the propor | tion was as about | 15 to 16. |
| And thus t | he third Law, | so far as it regards p | ercussions and ref | lexions, is |
| proved by a | theory exactl | y agreeing with exper | ience. |  |
| In attract | ions, I briefly | demonstrate the thi | ng after this manne | r. Sup |
| pose an obst | acle is interpo | sed to hinder the con | gress of any two | bodies A. |
| B, mutually | attracting on | e the other : then if | either body, as A | , is more |
| attracted to | wards the othe | r body B, than that | other body B is to | wards the |
| first body A | , the obstacle | will be more strongl | y urged by the pr | essure of |
| the body A | than by the | pressure of the body | B, and therefore | will not |
| remain in e | quilibrio : but | the stronger pressure | will prevail, and | will make |
| the system | of the two bo | dies, together with th | e obstacle, to move | directly |

towards  the parts  on which  B  lies ; arid in  free  spaces,  to go forward  in
infmitiim  with  a motion  perpetually  accelerated ; which  is absurd  and
contrary  to  the  first Law.   For, by the  first Law,  the system  ought  to per
severe  in  its state  of rest,  or  of moving  uniformly  forward  in a right  line  :
and  therefore  the  bodies  must  equally  press  the  obstacle,  and  be equally
attracted  one  by the other.  I made  the experiment  on  the loadstone  and
iron.  If  these, placed  apart  in  proper  vessels,  are  made  to float by one
another  in standing  water,  neither  of them  will  propel  the  other ; but,

by being  equally  attracted,  they  will sustain  each  other's  pressure,  and  restat last in an  equilibrium.
  So  the  gravitation  betwixt  the  earth  and  its parts  is mutual.  Let  the
earth FI  be cut by any  plane EG  into two  parts EGF
and EGI,  and  their weights  one  towards  the other
will be mutually  equal.  For  if by another  plane
HK,  parallel  to the former  EG,  the  greater  partFJ
EGI  is cut  into  two  parts EGKH   and  HKI.
whereof HKI   is equal  to the part EFG,   first  cut

oft', it is evident  that  the middle  part EGKH,   will
have  no  propension  by  its proper  weight  towards  either  side, but  will hang
as  it were,  and  rest in an  equilibrium  betwixt  both.  But  the  one  extreme
part HKI   will with  its whole  weight  bear upon  and  press  the middle  part
towards  the other  extreme  part EGF   : and  therefore  the  force  with  which
EGI,  the sum  of the parts HKI  and EGKH,   tends  towards  the  third  part
EGF,   is equal  to  the weight  of the  part HKI,  that  is, to the weight  of
the  third  part EGF.  And  therefore  the weights  of  the  two  parts EGI
and EGF,  one  towards  the  other,  are  equal,  as I was  to prove.  And  in
deed  if those  weights  were  not  equal,  the whole  earth  floating  in the  non-
resisting  aether would  give way  to the greater  weight,  and,  retiring  from
it, would  be carried  off in infinitum.
   And  as those  bodies  are  equipollent  in the congress  and  reflexion, whose
velocities  are  reciprocally  as their  innate  forces,  so in the  use  of mechanic
instruments  those  agents  are  equipollent,  and  mutually  sustain  each  the
contrary  pressure  of the  other, whose  velocities,  estimated  according  to the
determination  of the  forces,  are  reciprocally  as the  forces.
   So  those weights  are  of equal  force  to move  the  arms  of  a balance;
which  during  the  play of the  balance  are  reciprocally  as their  velocities
upw  ards  and downwards  ; that  is, if the  ascent  or descent  is direct,  those
weights  are  of  equal  force, which  are  reciprocally  as the  distances  of  the
 points  at which  they  are suspended  from  the  axis  oi  the  balance  : but  if
they  are turned  aside by the interposition  of oblique  planes,  or  other  ob
stacles, and  made  to  ascend  or descend  obliquely,  those  bodies  will  be
 equipollent,  wThich  are  reciprocally  as the heights  of  their  ascent  and  de
 scent  taken  according  to the  perpendicular  ; and  that  on  account  of  the
 determination  of gravity  downwards.

| towards the par | ts on whic | h B lies ; ar | id in free | spaces, to | go fo | rward in |
| infmitiim with | a motion | perpetually | accelerated | ; which | is abs | urd and |
| contrary to the | first Law. | For, by th | e first Law, | the system | ough | t to per |
| severe in its st | ate of rest, | or of moving | uniformly | forward i | n a ri | ght line : |
| and therefore | the bodies | must equal | ly press th | e obstacle, | and be | equally |
| attracted one | by the oth | er. I made | the experi | ment on the | loads | tone and |
| iron. If these | , placed a | part in prop | er vessels, | are made | to floa | t by one |
| another in sta | nding water | , neither o | f them wil | l propel t | he oth | er ; but, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | they will s | ustain each | other's pre | ssure, | and rest |
| by being equall
at last in an eq | y attracted
uilibrium. | , |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| So the grav | itation bet | wixt the eart | h and its | parts is mut | ual. | Let the |
| earth FI be cut | by any plan | e EG into tw | o parts EG | F |  |  |
| and EGI, and | their weigh | ts one towar | ds the oth | er |  |  |
| will be mutual | ly equal. | For if by | another pla | ne |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| HK, parallel t | o the form | er EG, the | greater pa | rtFJ |  |  |
| EGI is cut i | nto two p | arts EGKH | and HKI | . |  |  |
| whereof HKI | is equal to | the part EF | G, first c | ut |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| oft', it is eviden | t that the | middle part | EGKH, wi | ll |  |  |
| have no propen | sion by its | proper weig | ht towards | either side, | but | will hang |
| as it were, and | rest in an | equilibrium | betwixt bo | th. But t | he one | extreme |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| part HKI will | with its w | hole weight | bear upon | and press t | he mid | dle part |
| towards the ot | her extreme | part EGF | : and ther | efore the fo | rce wi | th which |
| EGI, the sum | of the parts | HKI and | EGKH, te | nds towards | the t | hird part |
| EGF, is equal | to the we | ight of the | part HKI, | that is, t | o the | weight of |
| the third part | EGF. An | d therefore | the weight | s of the t | wo pa | rts EGI |
| and EGF, one | towards th | e other, are | equal, as I | was to pr | ove. | And in |
| deed if those w | eights were | not equal, | the whole | earth floati | ng in | the non- |
| resisting aether | would giv | e way to the | greater w | eight, and, | retir | ing from |
| it, w ould be ca | rried off in | infinitum. |  |  |  |  |
| And as those | bodies are | equipollent | in the con | gress and r | eflexio | n, whose |
| velocities are r | eciprocally | as their inn | ate forces, | so in the us | e of | mechanic |
| instruments t | hose agents | are equipol | lent, and | mutually su | stain | each the |
| contrary pressu | re of the o | ther, whose | velocities, | estimated a | ccordi | ng to the |

  And  in like manner  in the pully,  or in  a  combination  of  pullies,  the
force  of a hand  drawing  the rope  directly, which  is to the weight,  whethel
ascending  directly  or obliquely,  as the velocity  of the perpendicular  ascent
of the weight  to the velocity  of the hand  that draws  the  rope,  will sustain
the weight.
   In  clocks  and  such  like  instruments,  made  up from  a combination  of
wheels,  the contrary  forces  that  promote  and  impede  the motion  of  the
wheels,  if they  are  reciprocally  as the  velocities  of  the parts of  the  wheel
on which  they  are impressed,  will mutually  sustain  the one  the  other.
  The  force  of  the screw  to press  a body  is to the force  of  the hand  that
turns  the  handles  by which  it is moved  as  the  circular  velocity  of  the
handle  in that  part where  it is impelled  by the hand  is to the progressive
velocity  of the screw  towards  the pressed  body.
  The  forces by which  the wedge  presses  or drives  the two  parts  of  the
wood  it cleaves  are  to the  force  of the mallet  upon  the wedge  as  the  pro-
press of  the wedge  in the direction  of  the  force impressed  upon  it by the
mallet  is to the velocity with  which  the  parts  of  the wood  yield  to  the
wedge,  in the direction  of lines perpendicular  to the  sides  of  the  wedge.
And  the  like account  is to be given  of all machines.
  The  power  and  use  of machines  consist  only  in this, that by diminishing
the velocity  we  may  augment  the  force, and  the  contrary  : from  whence
in  all sorts  of proper  machines,  we  have  the solution  of  this problem ; 7
move  a given  weight  with  a given  power,  or with  a given  force  to  over
come  any  other given  resistance.  For  if machines  are  so contrived  that  the
velocities  of  the  agent  and  resistant  are  reciprocally  as their  forces,  the
agent  will  just sustain  the  resistant,  but  with  a greater  disparity  of  ve
locity  will overcome  it.  So  that  if the disparity  of velocities  is so great
as  to overcome  all that  resistance  which  commonly  arises  either from  the
attrition  of contiguous  bodies  as  they  slide by one  another,  or from  the
cohesion  of continuous  bodies  that  are  to be separated,  or from  the weights
of bodies  to be raised,  the  excess  of the  force remaining,  after  all those  re
sistances  are overcome,  will produce  an  acceleration  of motion  proportional
thereto,  as well  in the parts  of {he machine  as in the  resisting body.  But
to treat  of mechanics  is not my  present  business.  I was  only willing  to
show  by those  examples  the great  extent  and  certainty  of the third Law  ot
motion.  For  if we  estimate  the action  of the  agent  from  its force and
velocity  conjunctly,  and  likewise  the reaction  of the impediment  conjuncth
from  the velocities  of  its several  parts, and  from  the forces  of  resistance
arising from  the  attrition,  cohesion,  weight,  and  acceleration  of those  parts,
the action  and  reaction  'YL the  use  of  all sorts  of machines  will  b" found
always  equal  to  one  another.  And  so far  as the  action  is propagated  by
the  intervening  instruments,  and  at  last impressed  upon  tic  resisting
body,  the ultimate  determination  of  the action  will  be always  contrary  to
the determination  of the  reaction.

| The fo | rce | of th | e screw to pres | s a body | is to the for | ce of th | e hand that |

Of  the method  of first and  last  ratios  of quantities,  by the help  wJicreoj
                 we demonstrate   the propositions  that follow.

                        LEMMA       I.

Quantities,  and  the ratios  of quantities,  which  in any  finite time  converge
   continually  to equality, and  before  the end  of that  time approach  nearer
   the  one  to the  other  than  by any  given  difference, become  ultimately
   equal.
   If you deny  it, suppose  them  to be  ultimately  unequal,  and  let D  be
their  ultimate  difference.  Therefore  they  cannot  approach  nearer   to
equality  than by  that given  difference  D  ; which  is against  the supposition,

                   LEMMA    II.

   lines  A a. AE,  and  the  curve  acE,  there  be  in
   scribed  any  number  of parallelograms  Ab,  Be,
  Cd,  fyc., comprehended  under  equal  bases  AB,
  BC,  CD,  ^«c., and  the  sides, Bb, Cc, Dd,  ^c.,         M                                                              a  parallel  to one  side  Aa  of  the figure ; and  the
  parallelograms  aKbl, bLcm,  cMdn,  §*c., are com

  AalbmcndoE,  and   en rvilijiear figure AabcdE,  will  have  to one  another,
   are  ratios  of equality.

  For  the  difference  of  the inscribed  and  circumscribed  figures  is the sum
of  the parallelograms  K7, Lw,  M//.  Do.  that  is (from  the equality  of  all
their  bases), the rectangle  under  one  of their  bases K6  and  the sum  of their

The  same  ultimate  ratios  are  also  ratios  of equality, when  the breadth^

  minished  in infinitum.

For  suppose AF  equal  to the greatest  breadth,  and
complete  the parallelogram FAaf.   This  parallelo
gram  will  be greater  than  the difference  of the  in
scribed  and  circumscribed  figures ; but, because  its
breadth AF   is diminished  in  infinitum,  it will  be

If in  two figures  AacE,  PprT,  you  inscribe  (as before)
   two  ranks  of parallelograms,  an  equal number  in

the parallelograms  in the other,  so (by composition)  is the  <

parts, when  their number   is augmented,  and  their magnitude  diminished
in  infinitum,  have  a given  ratio  one  to the  other,  the  first to the  first, the
second  to  the second, and  so on in order,  the whole  quantities  will  be one  to
the  other  in that same  given ratio.  For  if, in the figures  of this Lemma,
the parallelograms  are taken  one  to the  other  in the  ratio  of the  parts,  the
sum  of  the  parts  will  always  be  as the sum  of  the  parallelograms  ; and
therefore  supposing  the number  of the parallelograms  and  parts  to be aug
mented,  and  their magnitudes  diminished  in infinitum,  those  sums  will  be
in the ultimate  ratio  of  the parallelogram  in the one  figure  to  the  corres
pondent  parallelogram  in  the  other  ; that  is (by the  supposition),  in the
ultimate  ratio  of any  part  of the  one  quantity  to the correspondent  part  of
the  other.

                    LEMMA   V.

In  similar  figures,  all sorts of homologous  sides, whether  curvilinear   or
   rectilinear,  are proportional ; and  the areas  are  in the duplicate  ratio
   of  the homologous  sides.

                    LEMMA   VI.

If any  arc ACB,  given  in  position,  is snb-  _j
   tended  by  its chord  AB,  and  in any point
   A, in  the middle  of the contiinied  curva
   ture,  is touched  by a right  line AD,  pro
   duced  both ways ; then  if the points  A   R
  and  B  approach  one  another  and  meet,
   I say,  the angle  RAT),  contained  between,
   the chord  and  the tangent,  will  be dimin-      ?
   ished  in infinitum,  a/id ultimately  will vanish.
   For  if that  angle  does  not  vanish,  the  arc ACB  will  contain  with  the
tangent AD   an  angle  equal  to  a rectilinear  angle ; and  therefore  the  cur
vature  at the point A  will  not  be continued,  which  is against  the  supposi
tion.

                   LEMMA   VII.

 The  same  things  being  supposed,  I say  that  the ultimate  ratio of the arc,
   chord, and  tangent,  any  one  to any  other,  is the  ratio  of equality.
   For  while  the point B  approaches  towards  the point A, consider  always
AB  and AD   as produced  to the remote  points  b and  d, and  parallel  to the
secant BD  draw  bd : and  let the  arc Acb  be always  similar  to  the  arc
ACB.    Then,  supposing  the points A  and  B  to  coincide,  the  angle dAb
will vanish,  by the  preceding Lemma;  and  therefore  the  right  lines Ab,
 Arf (which  are always  finite), and  the intermediate  arc Acb,  will  coincide,

   If in comparing  indetermined  quantities  of  different  sorts  one  with
another,  any  one  is said  to be  as any  other  directly  or inversely,  the mean
ing  is, that  the former  is augmented  or diminished  in the same  ratio  with
the  latter,  or with  its reciprocal.  And  if any  one  is said  to be as any  other
two  or more  directly  or inversely,  the meaning  is, that  the  first  is aug
mented  or diminished  in the  ratio compounded  of the  ratios  in which  the
others,  or the reciprocals  of  the  others,  are augmented  or diminished.  As
if A  is said  to be  as B  directly, and  C  directly, and  D  inversely,  the mean
ing  is, that A  is augmented  or diminished  in the same  ratio with  B  X  C

X  -jj-, that  is to say, that A  and  -£• arc  one  to the  other  in  a given  ratio.

The  evanescent  subtense  of  the angle  of  contact,  in  all curves  which  at
   the point  of contact  have  a finite curvature,  is ultimately  in  the dupli
   cate  rati1) of the subtense  of the conterminate  arc.
  CASE  1. Let AB   be that  arc, AD   its tangent, BD
the subtense  of  the angle  of  contact  perpendicular  on
the  tangent, AB  the subtense  of  the arc.  Draw  BG
perpendicular  to the subtense  AB,  and AG   to the tan
gent AD,  meeting  in G  ; then  let the points D, B, and
G. approach  to the points  d, b, and  g, and  suppose  J
to be the ultimate  intersection  of  the  lines BG,  AG,
when  the points D, B, have  come  to A.   It is evident
that  the distance  GJ  may  be  less than  any  assignable.
But  (from  the nature  of the  circles  passing  through

the  points A,  B, G, A,  b, g,) AE2=  AG  X BD,  and
A62 =  Ag  X bd ; and  therefore  the  ratio of AB2  to Ab2  is compounded  oi
the  ratios  of AG   to Ag,  and  of Ed  to bd.  But  because  GJ  may  be  as
sumed  of less length  than  any  assignable,  the  ratio  of AG   to Ag  may  be
such  as  to  differ from  the  ratio  of  equality  by  less than  any  assignable
difference  ; and  therefore  the  ratio  of AB2  to Ab2 may  be such  as to differ
from  the  ratio  of BD   to bd by less than  any  assignable  difference.  There
fore, by Lem.  I, the ultimate  ratio  of AB2  to Ab2  is the same  with  tho  ul

time  in which  a body  will describe  the  arc  with  a given  velocity.

What  I call the sesquiplicate  ratio  is the subduplicate
of  the  triplicate,  as being compounded  of  the simple

AD,  Ad,  as  of the chords  and  arcs AB,  AB.

   But  we  have  all along  supposed  the angle  of contact  to  be neither  infi
nitely greater  nor  infinitely  less than  the angles  of  contact  made  by  cir
 cles and  their tangents ; that  is, that  the curvature  at the point A  is neither
 infinitely small  nor  infinitely  great,  or that  the interval  AJ  is of a finite mag

 through  the point  A, between  the  tangent AD  and  the  curve  AB,  and
 therefore  the  angle  of  contact  will  be infinitely  less than  those  of circles.

 And  by a like reasoning,  if DB  be made  successfully  as AD4,  AD5, AD8,

of which  is of  the  same  sort with  those  of  circles, the  second  infinitely
greater, and  every  succeeding  one  infinitely  greater  than  the  preceding.
But  between  any  two  of these  angles  another  series  of intermediate  angles
of contact may  be interposed,  proceeding  both  ways  in infinitum.  wherein
every  succeeding  angle  shall  be infinitely  greater  or infinitely  less than  the

the  series AD'f, ADy,  AD49, AD|, AD?,  AD|,  AD^1, AD^,  AD^7, &c.  And
again, between  any  two  angles  of this  series,  a new  series  of intermediate
angles may  be interposed,  differing from  one  another  by  infinite  intervals.
Nor  is nature  confined  to any  bounds.
   Those  things  which  have  been  demonstrated  of curve  lines, and  the
euperfices which  they comprehend,  may  be easily applied  to  the  curve  su-
perfices and  contents  of solids.  These  Lemmas   are premised  to avoid  the
 tediousness  of deducing  perplexed  demonstrations  ad absurdnm,  according
 to the method  of  the ancient  geometers.  For  demonstrations  are  more
contracted  by the method  of  indivisibles  : but  because  the  hypothesis  of
 indivisibles  seems  somewhat  harsh, and  therefore  that  method  is reckoned
 less geometrical,  I chose  rather  to reduce  the demonstrations  of the  follow
 ing propositions  to the  first and  last sums  and  ratios  of nascent  and  evane
 scent  quantities,  that  is, to the  limits  of those sums  and  ratios  ; and  so  to
 premise,  as short  as I could,  the demonstrations  of those limits.  For  hereby
 the same  thing  is performed  as by the method  of  indivisibles  ; and  now
 those  principles  being demonstrated,  we may  use  them  with  more  safety.
 Therefore  if hereafter  I should  happen  to consider  quantities  as made  up  of
 particles,  or should  use  little curve  lines  for right  ones, I would  not  be un-
 (lerstood  to mean  indivisibles,  but  evanescent  divisible  quantities  : not  the
 sums  and  ratios  of determinate  parts, but always  the limits  of sums  and
 ratios  ; and  that  the force  of such  demonstrations  always  depends  on  the
 method  laid down  in the foregoing Lemmas.
   Perhaps  it may  be  objected, that  there  is no  ultimate  proportion,  of
 evanescent  quantities ; because  the proportion,  before  the  quantities  have
 vanished,  is not  the ultimate,  and  when  they  are  vanished,  is none.  But
 by the same  argument,  it may  be  alledged,  that  a body  arriving  at  a  cer
 tain  place, and  there stopping  has  no  ultimate  velocity : because  the  velo
 city, before  the body  comes  to the  place,  is not  its ultimate  velocity  ; when
 it has  arrived,  is none   i ut the answer  is easy;  for by  the ultimate  ve
 locity  is meant  that with  which  the body  is moved,  neither  before  it arrives
 at its last place and  the motion  ceases,  nor  after, but  at the very instant  it
 arrives  ; that  is, that  velocity  with  which  the body  arrives  at  its last place,
 and  with which  the motion  ceases.  And  in like manner,  by the ultimate  ra
 tio of evanescent  quantities  is to Le understood  the  ratio  of  the  ijuantitiea

not before  they  vanish,  nor  afterwards,  but  with  which  they vanish.  In
like manner  the  first ratio  of nascent  quantities  is that with  which  they begin
to be.  And  the  first or last sum  is that  with  which  they begin  and  cease
to be (or to be augmented  or diminished).  There  is a limit  which  the  ve
locity  at the end  of the motion  may  attain, but  not  exceed.  This  is the
ultimate  velocity.  And  there  is the like  limit  in  all quantities  and  pro
portions  that begin  and  cease  to be.  And  since  such  limits  are  certain  and
definite,  to determine  the same  is a  problem  strictly geometrical.  But
whatever  is geometrical  we may  be allowed  to use  in determining  and  de
monstrating  any  other  thing  that  is likewise  geometrical.
   It may  also  be objected,  that  if the ultimate  ratios  of evanescent  quan
tities  are  given,  their ultimate  magnitudes  will  be also given  : and  so  all
quantities  will  consist  of  indivisibles, which  is contrary  to what  Euclid
has demonstrated  concerning  incommensurables,  in the  10th  Book  of  his
Elements.  But  this objection  is founded  on  a  false supposition.  For
those  ultimate  ratios  with  which  quantities  vanish  are  not  truly the  ratios
of ultimate  quantities,  but  limits  towards  which  the  ratios  of quantities
decreasing  without  limit  do always  converge  ; and  to which  they approach
nearer  than  by any given  difference,  but  never  go beyond,  nor  in effect attain
to, till the quantities  are diminished  in wfinitum.  This  thing  will appear
more  evident  in quantities  infinitely great.  If two  quantities,  whose  dif
ference  is given, be augmented  in infin&um,  the ultimate  ratio  of  these
quantities  will  be given,  to wit, the  ratio  of equality  ; but  it does  not from
thence  follow,  that  the ultimate  or  greatest  quantities  themselves,  whose
ratio  that  is, will  be given.  Therefore  if in what  follows,  for  the  sake  of
being  more  easily understood,  I should  happen  to mention  quantities  as
least, or evanescent,  or ultimate,  you  are  not  to suppose  that  quantities  of
any determinate  magnitude  are meant,  but  such  as  are  conceived  to be  al
ways diminished  without  end.

            PROPOSITION    I.  THEOREM    1.

The  areas,  which  revolving  bodies  describe  by radii drawn   to an  ^mmo-
   vable  centra  of force  do  lie in  tJ:e same  immovable  planes, and  are pro-
  portional  to the times  in which  they  are  described.
  For  suppose  the time  to be divided  into equal  parts, and  in the  first part
of  that time  let the  body  by  its innate  force  describe  the right  line AB
In the second  part  of that  time,  the same  would  (by Law   I.), if not hindered,

| not before they | vanish, nor afte | rwards, but w | ith which |  | they va | nish. In |
| like manner the | first ratio of nasc | ent quantities | is that wit | h | which | they begin |
| to be. And th | e first or last sum | is that with | which the | y | begin | and cease |
| to be (or to be | augmented or di | minished). Th | ere is a l | im | it whic | h the ve |
| locity at the en | d of the motion | may attain, b | ut not ex | cee | d. Th | is is the |
| ultimate veloci | ty. And there i | s the like limit | in all q | uan | tities | and pro |
| portions that b | egin and cease to | be. And sin | ce such lim | it | s are c | ertain and |
| definite, to det | ermine the same | is a proble | m strictly | ge | ometri | cal. But |
| whatever is geo | metrical we may | be allowed to | use in de | te | rmining | and de |
| monstrating an | y other thing th | at is likewise | geometrical | . |  |  |
| It may also | be objected, that | if the ultimate | ratios o | f | evanesc | ent quan |
| tities are given, | their ultimate | magnitudes wi | ll be also | gi | ven : a | nd so all |
| quantities will | consist of indivis | ibles, which | is contrar | y | to wha | t Euclid |
| has demonstrate | d concerning in | commensurables | , in the | 10 | th Bo | ok of his |
| Elements. But | this objection | is founded o | n a false | su | pposit | ion. For |
| those ultimate | ratios with which | quantities v | anish are | not | truly | the ratios |
| of ultimate qua | ntities, but limit | s towards whi | ch the r | ati | os of | quantities |
| decreasing with | out limit do alw | ays converge | ; and to w | hic | h they | approach |
| nearer than by | any given differen | ce, but never | go beyond, | no | r in ef | fect attain |
| to, till the quan | tities are dimini | shed in wfini | tum. This |  | thing w | ill appear |
| more evident in | quantities infin | itely great. | If two qua | nti | ties, | whose dif |

| quantities will | be given, to wit, | the ratio of e | quality ; | b ut | it does | not from |

 104                       THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES

scribed.  But  when  the body
is arrived  at  B,  suppose
that  a centripetal  force  acts
at  once  with  a  great  im
pulse, and, turning  aside  the
body  from  the right  line Be,
compels  it afterwards  to con
tinue  its motion  along  the
right  line BC.  Draw  cC
parallel  to BS  meeting BC
in C ; and  at the end  of the
second  part  of the time,  the
body  (by Cor.  I. of the Laws)
will  be found  in  C, in  the
same  plane  with  the triangle
A SB.   Join  SC,  and, because  s
SB  and  Cc  are  parallel, the  triangle SBC  will  be equal  to the triangle SBc,
and  therefore  also  to  the  triangle SAB.  By  the  like  argument,  if the
centripetal  force  acts  successively  in C, D, E. &c., and makes  the body,  in
each  single  particle  of time,  to describe  the right  lines CD,  DE,  EF7  &c.,
they  will  all lie in the same  plane  : and  the triangle SCD   will be equal  to
the triangle SBC,  and SDE   to SCD,  and SEF   to SDE.  And  therefore,
in equal  times, equal  areas  are described  in one immovable  plane : and, by
composition,  any  sums  SADS,  SAFS,  of those  areas,  are  one  to the  other
as the times  in which  they are described.  Now   let the number  of  those
triangles  be augmented,  and  their breadth  diminished  in wjinitum  ; and
(by Cor.  4, Lem.  III.) their  ultimate  perimeter ADF   will  be  a curve  line  :
and  therefore  the centripetal  force, by which  the body  is perpetually  drawn
back  from  the tangent  of this curve,  will  act continually  ; and  any described
areas SADS,  SAFS,  which  are  always  proportional  to  the times  of de
scription,  will, in this  case  also, be proportional  to those times.  Q.E.D.

in the position  which   it ultimately  acquires when  those  arcs  are diminished

| compels it afterwar | ds to con |  |  |  |  |  |

| SB and Cc are par | allel, the t | riangl | e SBC wi | ll be equal | to the | triangle SBc, |

times,  in spaces  void  of resistance,  are completed  into  the  parallelograms
ABCV,  DEFZ   : the  forces  in B  and E  are  one  to the  other  in the  ulti
mate  ratio  of the diagonals  BV, EZ, when  those  arcs  are diminished  in
infinitum.  For  the motions  BC  and EF  of  the  body  (by Cor.  1 of  the

Laws)  are compounded  of the  motions  Be, BV,  and  E/", EZ  : but BV  and
EZ,  which  are  equal  to Cc  and  F/, in the demonstration  of  this Proposi
tion, were  generated  by the impulses  of the  centripetal  force  in B  and  E;
and  are  therefore  proportional  to those  impulses.
   COR.  4. The  forces  by which  bodies, in  spaces  void  of  resistance,  are
drawn  back  from  rectilinear  motions,  and  turned  into  curvilinear  orbits,
are  one  to another  as the versed  sines  of arcs described  in equal  times  ; which
versed  sines  tend  to the  centre  of force, and  bisect  the  chords  when  those
arcs  are diminished  to infinity.  For  such  versed  sines  are  the halves  of
the diagonals  mentioned  in Cor.  3.
   COR.  5. And  therefore  those  forces  are  to the  force  of gravity  as the said
versed  sines  to the versed  sines perpendicular  to the horizon  of those  para
bolic  arcs which  projectiles  describe  in the same  time.
   COR.  6. And  the same  things  do  all hold good  (by Cor.  5 of  the Laws),
when  the planes  in which  the bodies  are moved,  together  with  the  centres
of force which  are  placed  in those  planes,  are  not  at  rest, but  move  uni
formly  forward  in right  lines.

            PROPOSITION    II.  THEOREM    II.

  A  body may  be  urged  by  a  centripetal  force compounded  of  several
forces ; in which  case  the meaning  of  the Proposition  is, that  the  force
which  results  out  of all tends  to the point S.  But  if any  force  acts  per
petually  in the  direction  of lines perpendicular  to  the  described  surface,
this force  will make  the body  to deviate  from  the plane  of  its motion  : but
will neither augment  nor diminish  the quantity  of the  described  surface
and  is therefore  to be neglected  in the composition  of forces.

           PROPOSITION    III.  THEOREM      III.

Every  body,  that by  a radius  drawn   to the centre  of another  body, how
   soever  moved,  describes  areas  about  that  centre  proportional  to  iJie times,
   is urged  by  a force compounded  out  of the centripetal  force Bending  fo
   that  other  body, and  of  all the accelerative  force  by which  that  other
  body  is impelled.
   Let  L represent  the one, and T  the other body  ; and  (by Cor.  0 of the Laws)
if both  bodies  are urged  in the  direction  of parallel  lines, by  a  ne T  force
equal and  contrary  to that by which  the second  body T  is tinned, the  first
body L  will go  on  to describe  about  the  other  body T  the same  areas  as
before  : but  the  force by which  that  other body T  was  urged  will  be now
destroyed  by an  equal  and  contrary  force;  and  therefore  (by Law   I.) that
other body  T, now  left  to itself, will  either  rest, or move  uniformly  forward
in  a right  line  : and  the  first body L  impelled  by the  difference  of  the
forces,  that  is, by the  force remaining,  will go  on  to describe  about  the other
body T  areas  proportional  to the times.  And  therefore  (by Theor.  II.) the
difference  ;f the  forces  is directed  to the other body T  as its centre. Q.E.D

describes  areas  proportional  to the times  ; and  from  the whole  force, by which
the  firr.t body L  is urged  (whether  that  force  is simple,  or, according  to
Cor.  2  of the Laws, compounded  out  of several  forces), we  subduct  (by the

the who_e  remaining  force by which  the  first body  is urged  will tend  to the

maining  force  will  tend  to the  other  body T  nearly.
   COR.  3. And  vice versa,  if the remaining  force  tends  nearly  to the other
body  T, those  areas  will  be nearly  proportional  to the times.
   COR.  4.  If the body  L, by  a radius  drawn  to the  other  body T, describes
areas,  which, compared  with  the times,  are  very  unequal  ; and  that  other

action  of the centripetal  force  tending  to that  other body T  is either  none
at  all, or  it is mixed  and compounded  with  very  powerful  actions  of  other
forces  : and  the whole  force compounded  of them  all, if they  are many,  is
directed  to another  (immovable  or moveaJble)  centre.  The  same  thing  ob
tains, when  the  other body  is moved  by any motion  whatsoever  ; provided
that  centripetal  force  is taken,  wrhich  remains  after subducting  that whole
force  acting upon  that  other body  T.

   Because  the  equable  description  of  areas  indicates  that  a centre  is re
spected by that  force with  which  the body  is most  affected, and  by which  it
is drawn  back  from  its rectilinear  motion,  and  retained  in  its orbit  ; why
may  we  not  be allowed,  in the following  discourse,  to use  the equable  de
scription  of  areas  as an indication  of  a  centre, about  which  all  circular
motion  is performed  in free spaces ?

           PROPOSITION    IV.  THEOREM    IV.

 The  centripetal  forces  of bodies, which  by equable  'motions  describe  differ
   ent  circles, tend  to the centres  of  the same  circles  ; and  are  one  to  tJie
   other  as  the squares  of t/ie arcs  described  in equal  times  applied  to the
   radii  of the  circles.
   These  forces  tend  to the  centres  of  the  circles  (by Prop.  II., and  Cor.  2,
Prop.  L), and  are  one  to another  as  the versed  sines  of  the  least  arcs de
scribed  in equal  times  (by Cor.  4, Prop.  I.) ; that  is, as the  squares  of  the
same  arcs  applied  to the diameters  of the  circles  (by Lem.  VII.) ; and  there
fore  since  those  arcs  are  as  arcs described  in any  equal  times, and  the  dia-

scr bed  in the same  time  applied  to the  radii  of the circles.  Q.E.D.

 the centripetal  forces  are  in  a ratio compounded  of  the  duplicate  ra'jio  of
 the velocities  directly, and  of the simple  ratio  of the  radii  inversely.
   COR.  2. And  since  the periodic  times  are  in  a ratio compounded  of the
ratio  of the  radii  directly, and  the  ratio  of the  velocities  inversely,  the  cen
tripetal  forces,  are  in  a ratio compounded   of the  ratio  of the  radii  directly,
and  the duplicate  ratio  of the periodic  times  inversely.
   COR,  3. Whence  if the  periodic  times  are  equal, and  the  velocities
therefore  as the  radii, the centripetal  forces  will be  also  as the  radii ; and
tke contrary.
   COR.  4.  If the  periodic  times  and  the  velocities  are both  in  the subdu-
plicate  ratio  of the  radii, the centripetal  forces  will  be equal among  them
selves  ; and  the contrary.
   COR.  5.  If the periodic  times  are  as the  radii, and  therefore  the  veloci

contrary.

and  therefore  the  velocities  reciprocally  in the  subduplicate  ratio  of  the

   COR.  7. And  universally,  if the periodic  time  is as any power  Rn  of the
radius  R, and  therefore  the  velocity  reciprocally  as the power Rn    ] of
the radius,  the centripetal  force  will  be reciprocally  as the power R2n   1 of
the radius;  and  the contrary.
   COR.  8. The  same  things  all hold  concerning  the  times, the  velocities,
and  forces by which  bodies  describe  the similar  parts  of any  similar  figures
that have  their  centres  in  a similar  position  with  those  figures  ; as appears
by applying  the demonstration  of the preceding  cases  to those.  And  the
application  is easy, by only substituting  the equable  description  of areas  in
the place  of equable  motion,  and  using  the distances  of the bodies  from  the
centres  instead  of the  radii.
  COR.  9. From  the same  demonstration   it likewise  follows,  that  the  arc
which  a body, uniformly  revolving  in a circle by means  of  a given  centri
petal  force, describes  in any  time,  is a mean  proportional  between  the
diameter  of the  circle, and  the space which  the same  body  falling by the
same  given  force would  descend  through  in the same  given  time.

 may  discover  the proportion  of  a  centripetal  force  to  any  other  known
 force, such  as that  of gravity.  For  if a body  by means  of  its gravity  re
 volves  in  a circle concentric  to  the  earth, this  gravity  is the  centripetal
 force  of that body.  But  from  the descent  of heavy  bodies,  the time  of one
 entire  revolution,  as well  as the  arc described  in any  given  time,  is given
 (by Cor.  9 of this Prop.).  And  by such  propositions,  Mr.  Huygens,  in his
excellent  book  De  Horologio  Oscillatorio,  has compared  the  force  of
gravity  with  the centrifugal  forces  of revolving  bodies.
   The  preceding  Proposition may  be  likewise  demonstrated  after  this
manner.  In any  circle suppose  a polygon  to be  inscribed  of any number
of sides.  And   if a body, moved  with  a given  velocity  along  the sides  of the
polygon,  is reflected  from  the  circle  at the  several  angular  points,  the  force,
with  which  at every  reflection  it strikes  the  circle, will be  as its velocity  :
and  therefore  the sum  of the  forces, in  a given  time, will be  as  that  ve
locity and  the number  of  reflections  conjunctly  ; that  is (if the species  of
the polygon  be given),  as the length  described  in that given  time, and  in

circle ; that  is, as  the  square  of that  length  applied  to the radius ; and
therefore  the polygon,  by having  its sides diminished  in'inftnitum,  coin
cides with  the  circle, as the square  of the  arc described  in  a given  time  ap
plied  to the radius.  This  is the  centrifugal  force, with  which  the  body
impels  the  circle ; and  to which  the  contrary  force, wherewith  the  circle
continually  repels  the body  towards  the  centre,  is equal.

   scribes  a given figure, by means   of forces  directed  to some  common
   centre  :  to find  that  centre.

reciprocally  proportional  to the velocities  of the
body in  the  points  P, Q, R, from  which  the
perpendiculars  were  raised ; that  is, so that PA
may  be  to QB   as the velocity  in Q  to the  velocity  in P, and QB  to RC
as the velocity  in R  to the velocity  in Q.  Through  the  ends  A, B, C, of

| The preceding | Proposition may | be likewise dem | onstrated | after this |
| manner. In any | circle suppose a po | lygon to be insc | ribed of a | ny number |

| polygon, is reflect | ed from the circle | at the several ang | ular points, | the force, |
| with which at eve | ry reflection it str | ikes the circle, wi | ll be as it | s velocity |
| and therefore the | sum of the forces, | in a given time, | will be as | that ve |
| locity and the nu | mber of reflections | conjunctly ; t hat | is (if the | species of |
| the polygon be gi | ven), as the length | described in that | given tim | e, and in |
| creased or diminis | hed in the ratio of | the same length | to the rad | ius of the |
| circle ; t hat is, a s | the square of th | at length applie | d to the ra | dius ; and |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| therefore the poly | gon, by having its | sides diminished | in'inftni | tum, coin |
| cides with the circ | le, as the square o | f the arc described | in a give | n time ap |
| plied to the radiu | s. This is the ce | ntrifugal force, w | ith which | the body |

In  a space  void  of resistance,  if a body  revolves  in any  orbit  about  an im
  movable  centre, and  in the least  time  describes  any  arc just  then, na
   scent  ; and  the versed  sine  of that  arc  is supposed  to be drawn   bisect
   ing  the chord,  and  produced  passing  through  the  centre  of force:  the
   centripetal  force  in  the middle  of the  arc  will  be as  the  versed  sine  di
   rectly and  the square  of the time  inversely.
   For  the versed  sine  in  a given  time  is as the  force  (by Cor.  4, Prop.  1) ;
and augmenting  the  time  in any  ratio, because  the  arc  will be augmented
in the same  ratio, the  versed  sine  will  be augmented  in the  duplicate  of
that  ratio  (by Cor.  2 and  3, Lem.  XL),  and  therefore  is as the force and  the
square  of  the  time.   Subduct  on  both  sides  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the
time, and  the  force  will  be as the versed  sine  directly,  arid the  square  of
the time  inversely.    Q.E.D.

the centripetal  force  is reciprocally  as  -  —  ry^~ —  J that  is (because AV2

3ube  of the chord PV  conjunctly.    Q.E.L
                        The  same  otherwise.

   On  the tangent PR  produced  let fall the  perpendicular  SY  ; and  (be
cause  of the similar  triangles SYP,  VPA),  we  shall have AV  to PV  as SP
                   SP  X PV        SP2  >< PV3
to SY,  and  therefore -- A^~—V- =  SY,  and  -  —A V ^-  =  SY2  X  PV.

And  therefore  (by Corol.  3 and  5, Prop.  VI), the centripetal  force  is recip-
          SP2  X  PV3
rocally  as  - ~~ry¥~~~  I *na*  *s (because AV  is given),  reciprocally  as  SP"
X  PV3.    Q.E.I.
   Con.  1. Hence  if the  given  point  S, to which  the centripetal  force  al
ways  tends,  is placed  in the circumference  of  the  circle,  as  at V, the  cen
tripetal  force  will  be  reciprocally  as the quadrato-cube  (or fifth power)  of
the altitude  SP.
   COR.  2. The  force  by which  the body P  in the
circle APTV   revolves  about  the  centre  of  force S
is to the  force  by which  the same  body  P may   re
volve  in  the  same  circle, and  in the same  periodic
time, about  any  other  centre  of  force R,  as RP2  X
SP  to the cube  of the  right  line SG,  which,  from
the  first centre  of  force  S  is drawn  parallel  to the
distance PR  of  the  body from  the second  centre  of  force R, meeting  the
tangent PG  of the  orbit  in G.  For  by the construction  of this Proposition,
the former  force  is to the  latter  as RP2  X  PT3  to SP2  X  PV3;  that  is, as
               SP3  X  PV3
SP  X RP2   to -- p™ —   ; or (because  of the similar  triangles PSG, TPV)
to SGS.
   COR.  3. The  force by which  the body  P  in any  orbit  revolves  about  the
centre  of  force  S,  is to the  force by which  the same  body may  revolve  in
the same  orbit, and  the same  periodic  time, about  any  other  centre  of force
R.  as the  solid SP  X  RP2,  contained  under  the distance  of  the body  from

first centre  of  the  force  S, parallel  to the  distance RP  of  the body  from
fch*3 second  centre  of force  R, meeting  the tangent PG  of the  orbit  in G.
For  the  force  in this  orbit  at any  point P  is the same  as in a circle of the

   — pp —  —  .  Therefore  (by Cor.  5, Prop.  VI), the  centripetal  force  is
             2BC2  X  CA2
reciprocally  as —   — ry~         ;  that  is (because  2I3C2 X  CA2  is given),  re

ciprocally  as-r^v;I O    that  is, directly  as the distance  PC.    QEI.

                                 TJie same  otherwise.

   [n the right  line PG  on  the  other  side of  the point T, take  the  point  u
so that Tu  may  be  equal  to TV  ; then  take  uV,  such  as  shall  be  to  v G  as

DC2  to PC2.  And  because  Qr9  is to PvG   as DC'2  to PC2  (by the  conic
sections), we  shall have  Qv2  •-= Pi' X «V.  Add  the rectangle  n.Pv  to both
sides, and  the square  of  the chord  of the arc PQ,  will  be equal  to the  rect
angle VPv  ; and  therefore  a circle  which  touches  the  conic  section  in P,
and  passes through  the point  Q,, will  pass  also through  the point V.  Now
let the points P  and  Q, meet, and  the  ratio  of nV  to rG, which  is the same
with  the  ratio  of DC2  to PC2,  will become  the  ratio  of PV  to PG,  or PV

to 2PC   : and  therefore PY  will  be equal  to  „„ —  .   And    therefore    the
force by which  the body  P  revolves  in the  ellipsis2DC2 will  be  reciprocally  as

given)  directly  as PC.    Q.E.I.
   COR.  1. And  therefore  the  force  is as the distance  of  the body  from  the
centre  of the  ellipsis ;  and,  vice versa,  if the  force  is as the  distance,  the
body  will move  in an  ellipsis whose  centre  coincides  with  the centre  of force,
or perhaps  in  a circle  into which  the  ellipsis may  degenerate.
   COR.  2. And  the  periodic  times  of the revolutions  made  in  all ellipses
whatsoever  about  the same  centre  will  be equal.  For  those  times  in sim
ilar  ellipses  will be  equal  (by Corol.  3  and  S, Prop.  IV) ; but  in  ellipses
that have  their greater  axis common,  they  are  one  to another  as the whole
areas  of the  ellipses  directly, and  the parts  of the  areas  described  in  the
same  time  inversely:  that  is, as the  lesser  axes  directly, and  the  velocities
of the bodies  in  their  principal  vertices  inversely ; :hat  is, as  those  lesser
axes  dirtily,  and  the ordinates  to the same  point  %f the common  axes  in
versely  ; and  therefore  (because  of  the equality  of  the  direct  and  inverse
ratios)  in the ratio  of  equality.

   If the  ellipsis, by having  its centre  removed  to an  infinite  distance,  de

generates  into  a parabola,  the  body  will  move  in  tin's parabola  ; and  the

equal  sides SP, SM  of  the  one, the  sides Px  or Q,R  and  Pv  of the  other
will  be also equal.  But  (by the conic  sections)  the square  of the  ordinate
Q,y  is equal  to the rectangle  under  the  latus rectum  and  the segment  Pv

4PS  X  Q,R  ; and  the points P and  Q, coinciding,  the  ratio  of Qv  to  Q,.r
(by Cor.  2, Lem.  VII.,) becomes  a ratio  of equality.  And  therefore  Q,#2, in
this  case, becomes  equal  to the rectangle 4PS  X Q,R.  But  (because  of the

similar  triangles Q#T,  SPN),  Q^'2  is to QT2  as PS2  to SN2,  that  is (by
Cor.  1, Lem.  XIV.),  as PS  to SA  ; that  is, as 4PS  X QR   to 4SA  x QR,

PR,  and  at the same  time  is urged  by the  action  of  a centripetal  force  that
is reciprocally  proportional  to the square  of the distance  of the places from
the  centre,  the body  will move  in one  of the  conic  sections, having  its fo
cus  in the  centre  of force ; and  the contrary.  For  the  focus, the  point  of
contact,  and  the position  of the  tangent,  being  given,  a conic  section may
be described,  which  at that  point  shall have  a given  curvature.  But  the
curvature  is given  from  the centripetal  force  and  velocity  of  the body  be

section  is also given.  Let  the angle RPH   be the complement  of the angle
RPS   to two  right ; and  the line PH,  in which  the  other  focus  II is placed,
is given  by position.  Let  fall SK  perpendicular  on PH,  and  erect  the
conjugate  semi-axis  BC  ; this done,  we  shall have SP2—  2KPH  +  PH2
=  SH2 =  4CH2  =  4BH2  —  4BC2 =  SP  + PH2—  L  X SiM
SP2  + 2SPH  +  PH2 —  L  x  SP  +  PH.    Add  on both  sides 2KPH  —
SP2— PH2  + L X SP  + PH,  and we  shall  have L X  SP  +  PH  = 2SPH
 f 2KPH,   or SP  + PH   to PH,  as 2SP  + 2KP  to L.  Whence  PH   is
given  both  in length and  position.  That  is, if the velocity  of the body
in P  is such  that  the  latus  rectum  L  is less than 2SP  +  2KP,  PH   will

lie on  the same  side of  the tangent PR  writh  the  line SP  ; and  therefore
the  figure will  be  an  ellipsis, which  from  the given  foci  S, H, and  the
principal  axis SP  +  PH,  is given also.  But  if the velocity  of  the body
is so great,  that  the  latus  rectum  L  becomes  equal  to 2SP  +  2KP,  the
length PH   will be  infinite ; and  therefore,  the  figure will  be  a  parabola,
which  has  its axis SH  parallel  to the  line PK,  and  is thence  given.  But
if the body  goes from  its place P with  a yet  greater  velocity,  the  length
PH   is to be taken  on  the  other  side  the tangent  ; and  so the  tangent  pas
sing between  the  foci, the figure  will  be an hyperbola  having  its principal
axis  equal  to the  difference  of  the  lines SP  and  PH,  and  thence  is given.
Por  if the  body,  in  these  cases, revolves  in  a conic  section  so found,  it is
demonstrated  in  Prop. XI, XII,  and  XIII,  that  the centripetal  force  will
be reciprocally  as the square  of the  distance  of  the body  from  the centre
of force S ; and  therefore  we  have  rightly determined  the  line PQ,, which
a body  let go from  a given  place P  with  a  given  velocity, and  in  the  di
rection  of the right  line PR  given by position, would  describe  with  such  a
force.  Q.E.F.
  COR.  1. Hence  in  every  conic  section, from  the principal  vertex  D, the
latus rectum  L, and  the  focus  S  given, the  other  focus H  is given, by
taking DH   to DS  as the  latus rectum  to the difference  between  the  latus
rectum  and 4US.  For  the proportion, SP  + PH   to PH  as 2SP  + 2KP
to L, becomes,  in the  case  of this Corollary, DS  + DH   to DH   as 4DS   to
L, and  by division DS  to DH   as 4DS  —  L  to L.
   COR.  2. Whence   if the velocity  of a body  in  the  principal  vertex D  ig
given,  the  orbit may  be readily found ; to wit, by taking  its latus rectum
to twice  the distance  DS,  in the duplicate  ratio  of  this given  velocity  to
the velocity  of a body revolving  in  a  circle  at the distance DS  (by Cor.
3, Prop.  XVI.), and  then  taking DH   to DS  as the  latus  rectum  to the
difference  between  the  latus rectum  and 4DS.

| f 2KPH, or S | P | + PH | to PH, as | 2SP + 2 | KP to | L. Whence | PH is |
| given both in l | en | gth and | position. | That is, | if the | velocity of | the body |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

About  a given focus  to describe  any  trajectory  given  in specie which  shah
  pass  through  given  points, and  touch  right  lines given  by position.
  CASE  1. About  the  focus  S   it  is  re-
 uired  to  describe  a trajectory ABC,  pass
ing through  two  points  B, C.   Because  the
trajectory  is given  in specie,  the ratio  of the
principal  axis  to the  distance  of the  foci GAS       H
will  be given.  In  that  ratio  take KB   to BS,  and LC  to CS.  About  the
centres  B, C, with  the  intervals BK,  CL,  describe  two  circles ; and  on  the
right  line KL,  that  touches  the same  in K  and  L, let fall the perpendicu
lar SG  ; which  cut  in A  and  a, so that GA  may  be  to AS,  and Ga  to aS,
as KB   to BS  ; and  with  the axis  A.«, and  vertices  A, a, describe  a trajectory   :
I say  the thing  is done.  For  let H  be  the  other  focus  of the  described
figure, and  seeing GA   is to AS  as Ga  to  aS, then  by division  we  shall
have Ga — GA,  or Aa  to «S — AS,  or SH  in the same  ratio; and  therefore
in the  ratio which  the principal  axis of the  figure  to be  described  has  to
the distance  of its foci ; and  therefore  the described  figure  is of the  same
species with  the  figure which  was  to be described.  And  since KB   to BS,
and LC  to CS,  are  in the  same  ratio, this  figure  will  pass through   tht-
points  B, C, as  is manifest  from  the  conic  sections.
  CASE  2. About  the  focus  S  it is required  to
describe  a  trajectory which  shall somewhere
touch  two  right  lines TR,  tr.  From  the focus
on  those  tangents  let  fall  the  perpendiculars
ST,  St, which  produce  to  V, v, so that TV,  tv
may  be  equal  to TS, tS.  Bisect Vv  in O, and  j

the right  line VS  infinitely produced  in K  and  V
k, so that VK  be  to KS,  and  VA*  to A~S, as the  principal  axis  of  the  tra
jectory  to be  described  is to  the  distance  of  its foci.  On  the  diameter
K/J  describe  a  circle cutting OH  in H  ; and  with  the  foci S, H,  and
principal  axis equal  to VH,  describe  a trajectory  : I say, the thing  is done.
For  bisecting Kk  in X,  and  joining HX,  HS, HV,  Hv,  because VK   is  to
KS  as VA-  to  A*S ; and  by composition,  as VK   -f- V/c  to KS  +  kS ; and
by  division,  as  VA* — VK   to kS —  KS,  that  is, as 2VX   to 2KX,  and
2KX   to 2SX,  and  therefore  as VX   to HX  and HX   to SX,  the  triangles
VXH,  HXS   will  be similar ; therefore VH   will  be to SH  as VX  to XH  ;
and  therefore  as VK  to KS.  Wherefore  VH,  the  principal  axis  of  the

from  the nature  of the  hyperbola, ZR  will

          PROPOSITION   XXL    PROBLEM     XIII.

 About  a  given focus  to describe  a  trajectory  that  shall pass  through
   given  points  and  touch  right  Hues  given  by position.
    Let  the focus  S, the point  P, and  the tangent TR  be given, and  suppose
 that the  other  focus H  is to be  found.
 On  the tangent  let fall the perpendicular
 ST,  which  produce  to Y, so that TY  may
 be equal  to ST,  and YH   will  be equal
 to the principal  axis.    Join  SP, HP,  and
 SP  will  be the difference  between  HP  and
 the  principal  axis.   After  this manner,
 if more  tangents TR   are  given,  or more
 points  P. we  shall  always  determine   as
many  lines YH,  or PH,  drawn  from  the  said points Y  or P, to the  focus
 H, which  either  shall  be equal  to the  axes,  or differ from  the axes  by given
 lengths  SP  ; and  therefore  which  shall  either  be equal among  themselves,
 or shall have  given  differences ; from  whence  (by the preceding Lemma).
 that  other  focus H  is given.    But  having  the foci and  the length  of  the
 axis (which  is either YH,  or, if the  trajectory  be an  ellipsis, PH  -f SP  ;
 or PH  —  SP,  if it be an hyperbola),  the trajectory  is given.    Q.E.I.

                      SCHOLIUM.

  When   the trajectory  is an hyperbola,  I do not comprehend  its conjugate
hyperbola  under  the name  of tins trajectory.  For  a body going  on  with  a
continued  motion  can  never  pass out  of one  hyperbola  into  its conjugate
hyperbola.
   The  case when  three  points  are  given
 is more  readily  solved  thus.  Let  B, C,

      How  the orbits  are  to be found  when  neither focus  is given.

 If from  any  point P  of a given  conic  section,  to  the four  produced  sides
  AB,  CD,  AC,  DB,  of any  trapezium ABDC   inscribed  in that  section,

   as many  right  lines PQ,  PR,  PS, PT  are drawn  in given  ang7ei,
   each  line  to each  side ;  the rectangle  PQ,  X PR  of those  on  the opposite
   sides AB,  CD,  will  be  to the rectangle  PS  X PT  of those  on  tie other
   two  opposite  sides AC, BD,  in  a given  ratio.
  CASE  1. Let  us suppose,  first, that  the lines drawn
to one  pair  of opposite  sides  are  parallel  to  either  of    I ^^            p     ;T
the other  sides ; as PQ  and PR  to the  side AC,  and s|
PS  and PT   to the  side  AB.   And  farther,  that  one
pair  of the opposite  sides, as AC  and  BD,  are  parallel
betwixt  themselves;  then  the right  line which bisects^     IQ       I3
those  parallel  sides  will  be one  of the diameters  of the        1L
conic  section, and  will  likewise  bisect RQ.   Let O  be the  point  in which
RQ   is bisected, and PO  will be an  ordinate  to that  diameter.  Produce
PO  to K,  so that OK  may  be equal  to PO,  and OK  will  be an  ordinate
on  the other  side of that diameter.  Since,  therefore,  the points A, B; P
and K  are placed  in the conic  section, and PK  cuts AB  in a given  angle,
the rectangle PQK   (by Prop. XVII.,  XIX.,  XXI.  and XXI1L,  Book   III.,
of Apollonius's  Conies)  will be to  the  rectangle AQB   in  a given  ratio.
But QK  and PR  are  equal,  as being  the  differences  of the equal  lines OK,
OP,  and OQ,  OR  ; whence  the rectangles PQK   and PQ  X PR  are equal ;
and  therefore  the rectangle PQ  X PR   is to the rectangle A^  B, that  Is, to

sense, comprehending   as well  the  rectilinear  section through  the vertex  of
the  cone,  as  the circular  one  parallel  to the base.  For  if the  point p hap

is that  right  line upon  which  the  point p  falls,
and  the  other  is a right  line  that  joins the other
two  of *he four points.  If the two  opposite  an

  And  so we  have  given  in this Corollary  a solution  of that famous  Prob
lem  of the ancients  concerning  four  lines, begun  by Euclid,  and  carried  on
by Apollonius  ; and  this not  an  analytical  calculus,  but  a geometrical  com

                   LEMMA  XX.

If the two  opposite  angular  points  A  and  P of any parallelogram ASPQ
   touch  any  conic  section  in  the points  A  and  P  ; and  the sides AQ, AS
   of one  of those  angles,  indefinitely produced,  meet  the same  conic  section
   in B and  C  ; and  from  the points  of concourse,  B and  C  to any  fifth
   point D  of the conic  section,  two  right  lines BD, CD   are drawn  meet-
  ing  tlie two  other  sides  PS, PQ  of  the parallelogram,  indefinitely  pro
   duced  in T  and  R  ; the parts PR  and  PT,  cut  off from  the  sides, will
  always  be one  to the other  in  a given  ratio.  And  vice  versa,  if those

  parts  cut  off' are  one  to the other  in  a given  ratio,  the locus  of the point
   D  will  be a conic  section passing  through  the four  points  A, B, C, F
  CASE  1. Join BP,  CP,  and  from  the point
D  draw  the two  right  lines DG,  DE,  of which
the  first DG   shall  be  parallel  to AB,  and
meet  PB, PQ, CA  in H,  I, G  ; and  the other
DE  shall  be parallel  to AC,  and  meet  PC,
PS, AB,  in  F, K, E  ; and  (by Lem.  XVII)
the rectangle DE  X DF  will  be  to the  rect
angle  DG     X  DH   in  a  given  ratio.   But
PQ  is to DE   (or IQ)  as PB   to HB,  and  con
sequently  as PT  to DH  ; and  by permutation  PQ,  is  to PT   as DE   to
DH.    Likewise  PR   is to DF   as RC  to DC,  and  therefore  as (IG  or) PS
to DG  ; and  by permutation PR  is to PS  as DF   to DG  ; and, by com
pounding  those  ratios, the  rectangle PQ  X PR  will  be  to the  rectangle
PS  X PT   as the rectangle DE  X DF   is to  the  rectangle DG  X DH.

and  consequently  in "a given  ratio.   But PQ  and  PS  are given,  and  there

   CASE  2. But  if PR  and PT  are supposed  to be in  a given  ratio  one  to
the  other,  then  by going  back  again,  by a like  reasoning,  it will  follow
that  the  rectangle DE  X DF   is to the rectangle DG  X DH   in  a given
rati) ; and  so the point D  (by Lem.  XVIII)  will  lie in  a conic  section  pass

   COR.  1. Hence  if we  draw  BC  cutting PQ  in  r and  in PT  take  Pt  to
Pr  in the same  ratio which PT  has  to PR  ; then  Et  will  touch  the  conic
section  in the point B.  For  suppose  the point D  to coalesce  with  the point
B, so that  the  chord BD  vanishing, BT  shall become  a tangent,  and CD
and BT   will coincide  with CB  and  Bt.
   COR.  2. And,  vice  versa,  if Bt  is a tangent,  and  the  lines BD, CD  meet
in any  point D  of  a conic  section, PR  will  be to PT  as Pr  to Pt.  And,
on  the contrary,  if PR   is to PT  as Pr  to Pt, then BD  and CD  will meet
in some  point D  of  a conic  section.
   COR.  3. One  conic  section  cannot  cut another  conic  section  in more  than
four points.  For,  if it is possible,  let two  conic  sections  pass through  the

h've points  A, B, C, P, O ; and  let the  right  line BD   cut them  in  the
points D, d, and  the right  line Cd  cut  the right  line PQ,  in q.  Therefore
PR   is to PT  as Pq  to PT  : whence  PR  and  Pq  are  equal  one  to the other,
against  the supposition.

NBM   and PBT, NCM   and PCR  equal;  and  therefore  the triangles NBM,
PBT   are  similar,  as  also  the  triangles NCM,  PCR.   Wherefore  PT   is to
NM   as PB  to NB  ; and PR  to NM   as PC  to NC.  But  the  points, B, C,
N, P  are immovable:  wheiefore  PT  and PR  have  a given  ratio  to NM,
and  consequently  a given  ratio between  themselves;  and  therefore,  (by
Lemma  XX)  the point D  wherein  the moveable  right  lines BT  and CR
perpetually  concur,  will  be placed  in  a conic  section  passing  through  the
points  B. C, P.  Q.E.D.
   And,  vice  versa,  if the moveable  point

 the given  points  B, C, A  ; and  the angle
DBM   is always  equal  to the given  an
gle ABC,  and  the  angle DCM   always
equal  to the given  angle ACB,  and when
the  point D  falls successively  on  any
two immovable  points p, P, of  the conic
section,  the moveable  point M  falls  suc
cessively  on  two immovable  points  /?, N.
Through  these  points  ??, N, draw  the right  line nN  : this line nN  will  be
the perpetual  locus  of  that moveable  point M.   For,  if  possible,  let  the
point M  be placed  in any  curve  line.  Therefore  the point D  will  be placed
in  a conic  section  passing  through  the  five  points  B, C, A, p, P, when  the

To  describe  a trajectory  that  shall  pass  through  four  given  points, and

line  tr  parallel  to TR,  cutting  off
from  PQ,  PS,  the segments  Pr, Pt proportional  to PR, PT  respectively  ;
and  draw  Cr, Bt  their point  of concourse  d  will (by Lem.  XX)  always  fall

 Mark  the points M, N, on  which  the  leg BC  of
 the angle  cuts  that  radius  when  BH;  the  other
 leg thereof, meets  the same  radius  in  the  points
 P and D.  Then  drawing  the  indefinite  line MN,
 let that  radius CP  or CD  and  the leg BC  of  the
 angle  perpetually  meet  in  this  Ikie; and  the
 point  of concourse  of the  other  leg BH  with  the
 radius  will delineate  the trajectory  required.
   For  if in the constructions  of the preceding  Problem  the point A  comes
 to  a coincidence  with  the point B, the  lines CA  and CB  will coincide,  and
 the  line AB,  in  its last situation,  will become  the tangent BH  ; and  there

To  describe  a trajectory  that  shall pass  through  three given  points, and

IZ  is to LP  as SI  to SL.  Wherefore  the points  S, P, Z. are  in one  right
line.  Moreover,  since  the tangents  meet  in G,  the  rectangle XI Y  or IZ2
will (by the  properties  of the  conic  sections)  be  to IA2  as GP2  is to GA2,
and  consequently  IZ  will be  to I A  as GP  to GA.  Wherefore  the  points
P, Z, A,  lie in one  right  line, and  therefore  the points  S, P, and A  are  in
one  right line.  And  the same  argument  will prove  that  the  points R, P,
and A  are  in one  right line.  Wherefore  the points  of contact  A  and  P  lie
in the right  line RS.  But  after  these  points  are found,  the trajectory may
be described,  as in the  first Case  of the preceding Problem.  Q,.E.F.
   In  this Proposition,  and  Case  2 of  the  foregoing,  the constructions  are
the  same,  whether  the  right  line XY  cut  the  trajectory  in X  and  Y,  or
not ; neither  do  they depend  upon  that  section.  But  the constructions
being demonstrated  where  that  right  line does  cut  the  trajectory,  the  con

structions  where  it does  not  are  also known  ; and  therefore,  for brevity's
sake,  I omit  any  farther  demonstration  of them.

                   LEMMA   XXII.

        To  transform  figures  into  other figures  of  the same  kind.
  Suppose  that any  figure HGI   is to  be
transformed.  Draw,  at pleasure,  two  par
allel lines AO,  BL,  cutting  any  third  line
AB,  given by position,  in A  and  B, and from
any  point G  of the  figure, draw  out  any
right  line GD,  parallel  to OA,  till it meet
the  right  line AB.  Then  from  any  given
point 0  in the  line OA,  draw  to  the  point
D  the  right  line OD,  meeting  BL  in d ; and
from  the point  of concourse  raise  the right
line dg  containing  any given  angle with  the  right  line BL,  and having
such  ratio  to Qd  as DG  has  to OD  ; and  g  will  be the point  in the  new
figure hgi, corresponding  to the point G.  And  in like manner  the several
points  of the  first figure  will give  as many  correspondent  points  of the new
figure.  If we  therefore  conceive  the point G  to be carried  along by  a con
tinual  motion  through  all the  points  of  the  first figure,  the point g  will
be likewise  carried  along by  a continual  motion  through  all the points  of

the new  figure, and  describe  the same.  For  distinction's  sake,  let us  call
DG   the  first ordinate, dg  the new  ordinate, AD   the  first  abscissa, ad  the
new  abscissa ; O  the  pole. OD  the abscinding  radius, OA  the  first ordinate
 radius, and Oa  (by which  the parallelogram OABa   is completed)  the  new
 ordinate  radius.
    I say, then,  that  if the point G  is placed  in  a right  line given  by posi

| be likewise car | ried along | by a continual | motion thr | ough all | the points of |

in a conic section.  And  here  I understand  the  circle  as one  of the conic
sections.  But  farther,  if the point G  is placed  in a line of  the  third  ana
lytical  order,  the point g  will  also  be placed  in a line  of the  third  order,
and  so on  in curve  lines of higher  orders.  The  two  lines  in which  the
points  G, g,  are  placed,  will  be always  of  the same  analytical  order.  For
as ad  is to OA,  so are Od  to OD,  dg  to DG,  and AB  to AD  ; and  there-
                OA  X AB         OA  X dg
fore AD   is equal  to ad,      , and DG  equal  to     ad7— —  .  Now   if the

point G  is placed  in  a right  line, and  therefore,  in any  equation  by which
the relation  between  the  abscissa AD  and  the  ordinate GD   is expressed,
those indetermined  lines AD  and DG   rise no higher  than  to one  dimen-
         v       v   xu-      ,.   OA  X AB .           OA  X dg
sion, by  writing  this equation—                        .     m  place  of AD,  and —    —    -.—  -

in place  of DG,  a new  equation  will  be  produced,  in which  the new  ab
scissa ad  and  new  ordinate dg  rise  only  to one  dimension  ; and  which
therefore  must  denote  a  right  line.  But  if AD  and DG   (or either  of
them)  had  risen  to two  dimensions  in the  first equation,  ad  and dg  would
likewise  have  risen  to tAvo dimensions  in the second  equation.  And  so  on
in  three  or more  dimensions.  The  indetermined  lines, ad} dg  in  the
second  equation,  and AD,  DG,  in  the  first, will always  rise  to the same
number  of dimensions  ; and  therefore  the  lines  in which  the points  G, g,
are  placed  are  of the same  analytical  order.
   I say farther,  that  if any  right  line  touches  the curve  line  in the  first
figure, the same  right  line  transferred  the same  way  with  the curve  into
the new  figure  will touch  that  curve  line  in the new  figure, and  vice  versa.
For  if any  two  points  of the  curve  in the  first figure  are supposed  to ap
proach  one  the  other  till they come  to coincide,  the same  points  transferred
will approach  one  the  other  till they come  to coincide  in the new  figure ;
and  therefore  the right  lines with  which  those  points  are  joined  will  be
come  together  tangents  of the curves  in both  figures.  I might  have  given
demonstrations  of these  assertions  in  a more  geometrical  form ; but  I study
to be  brief.
   Wherefore   if one  rectilinear  figure  is to be transformed  into another,  we
need  only  transfer  the  intersections  of the  right  lines  of which  the  first
figure  consists, and  through  the transferred  intersections  to draw  right  lines
in  the new  figure.  But  if a  curvilinear  figure  is to be transformed,  we
must  transfer  the  points,  the  tangents,  and  other  right  lines, by means  of
which  the curve  line  is denned.  This Lemma   is of  use  in the solution  of

the more  difficult Problems  ; for thereby  we  maj' transform  the  proposed
figures,  if they  are  intricate,  into  others  that  are more  simple.  Thus  any
right  lines converging  to  a point  are transformed  into  parallels, by taking
for the  first ordinate  radius  any  right  line that  passes through  the  point
of concourse  of  the converging  lines, and  that  because  their  point  of  con-

| lytical order, the p | oint g | will also be pla | ced in a li | ne of the t | hird order, |
| and so on in curve | lines o | f higher order | s. The t | wo lines in | which the |
| points G, g, are pl | aced, wi | ll be always of | the same | analytical o | rder. For |
| as ad is to OA, so | are Od | to OD, dg to | DG, and | AB to AD ; | and there- |
|  | OA X | AB | O | A X dg |  |
| fore AD is equal | to | a, ,d a nd DG | equal to | ad7 — — . | Now if the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| point G is placed | in a rig | ht line, and the | refore, in | any equation | by which |
| the relation betwee | n the a | bscissa AD an | d the ordi | nate GD is | expressed, |

| in place of DG, | a new e | quation will be | produced, | in which t | he new ab |
| scissa ad and new | ordina | te dg rise on | ly to one | dimension ; | and which |
| therefore must de | note a | right line. B | ut if AD | and DG (o | r either of |
| them) had risen to | two di | mensions in the | first equat | ion, ad and | dg would |
| likewise have rise | n to tAvo | dimensions in | the second | equation. | And so on |
| in three or more | dimens | ions. The in | determined | lines, ad} | dg in the |
| second equation, | and AD, | DG, in the | first, will | always rise t | o the same |
| number of dimens | ions ; | and therefore t | he lines in | which the p | oints G, g, |
| are placed are of t | he same | analytical orde | r. |  |  |
| I say farther, t | hat if a | ny right line | touches the | curve line | in the first |
| figure, the same | right li | ne transferred | the same w | ay with the | curve into |
| the new figure will | touch | that curve line | in the new | figure, and | vice versa. |
| For if any two po | ints of | the curve in t | he first fig | ure are suppo | sed to ap |
| proach one the oth | er till t | hey come to co | incide, the | same points | transferred |
| will approach one | the ot | her till they co | me to coin | cide in the n | ew figure |
| and therefore the | right lin | es with which | those poin | ts are joine | d will be |
| come together tang | ents of | the curves in b | oth figure | s. I might | have given |
| demonstrations of | these as | sertions in a mo | re geometr | ical form ; | b ut I s tudy |
| to be brief. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Wherefore if on | e rectili | near figure is t | o be transf | ormed into a | nother, we |
| need only transfer | the inte | rsections of th | e right li | nes of which | the first |
| figure consists, and | throug | h the transferre | d intersect | ions to draw | right lines |
| in the new figure | . But | if a curvilinea | r figure is | to be trans | formed, we |
| must transfer the | points, | the tangents, a | nd other r | ight lines, b | y means of |
| which the curve li | ne is de | nned. This L | emma is of | use in the | solution of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the more difficult | Problems | ; f or thereby | we maj' t | ransform the | proposed |
| figures, if they are | intricat | e, into others | that are mo | re simple. | Thus any |

| for the first ordina | te radiu | s any right lin | e that pas | ses through | the point |

   This Lemma   is also of  use  in the  solution  of solid problems.  For  as

may  be solved, any  one  of them  may  be transformed,  if it is an hyperbola
or  a parabola,  into  an  ellipsis, and  then  this  ellipsis may  be easily changed
into  a circle.  So  also  a right  line  and  a conic  section,  in the construc

         PROPOSITION   XXV.   PROBLEM    XVII.

 To  describe  a trajectory  that  shall pass  through  two  given  points, and
   touch  three right  lines given  by position.
  Through  the concourse  of any  two  of the  tangents  one  with  the  other,
and  the concourse  of the  third  tangent  with  the  right  line which  passes
through  the two  given  points, draw  an  indefinite  right  line ; and,  taking
this  line  for the  first ordinate  radius, transform  the figure by the preceding
Lemma   into  a new  figure.  In  this figure  those two  tangents  will become
parallel  to  each  other, and  the third  tangent  will  be parallel  to the right
line  that  passes through  the two  given  points.  Suppose  hi, kl to be those
two  parallel  tangents,  ik  the  third  tangent,  and  hi  a right  line parallel
thereto, passing  through  those  points  a, b,
through  which  the conic  section ought  to  pass
in this new  figure;  and  completing  the  paral-

BO cut  in c, d, e, that  he may  be  to  the  square
root  of the rectangle  ahb,  ic, to  id, and  ke  to
kd.  as the sum  of  the  right  lines  hi and  kl  is

to the sum  of  the  three  lines, the  first whereof      '
is the right  line  ik, and  the other  two  are  the
square  roots  of  the rectangles  ahb  and  alb ; and  c, d, e, will be the points
of contact.  For  by  the properties  of  the  conic  sections,  he2  to the rectan
gle ahb, and  ic2 to id2, and  ke2  to kd2, and  el2 to the rectangle  alb, are  all
in the same  ratio ; and  therefore  he  to the square  root  of ahb,  ic to id, ke
to kdj and  el to the square  root  of  alb, are  in  the  subduplicate  of  that

To  this  let EH   be taken  equal, and ELKH   will be always  a parallelogram.
And  therefore  the point K   is always  placed  in  the side HK   (given by po
tiition) of that  parallelogram.    Q.E.D.
   COR.  Because  the  figure EFLC   is given  in  kind,  the  three  right  lines
EF,  EL,  and  EC,  that  is, GD,  HK,  and  EC,  will have  given  ratios  to
each  other.

                  LEMMA  XXIV.

If three right  lines, two  whereof  are  parallel,  and  given  by position,  touch
   any  conic  section ; I say,  that  the semi-diameter  of  the section  wkiJt
    is parallel  to those  two  is a mean  proportional  between  the segments
   of those  two  that  are intercepted  between  the points  of  contact and   the.
   third  tangent.
   Let AF, GB  be the two  parallels  touch
ing  the  conic  section ADB   in A  and  B  ;
EF  the  third  right  line touching  the  conic
section  in  I, and  meeting  the  two  former
tangents  in F  and  G, and  let CD  be  the
semi-diameter  of  the  figure  parallel  to
those  tangents ; I  say. that AF,  CD, BG
are  continually  proportional.
   For  if the conjugate  diameters  AB,  DM G        Q
meet  the tangent FG  in E  and  H, and  cut  one  the  other  in  C; and  the
parallelogram IKCL   be completed  ; from  the nature  of  the conic  sections,
EC  will  be  to CA  as CA  to CL  ; and  so by division, EC  —  CA  to CA  -—
CL, orEAto  AL;  and by composition, EA   to EA  + AL  or EL,  as EC   to
EC  + CA  or EB  ; and  therefore  (because  of the similitude  of  the triangles
EAF,  ELI, ECH,  EBG)  AF   is to LI  as CH   to BG.   Likewise,  from  tli?
nature  of  the  conic  sections, LI  (or CK)  is to CD  as CD   to CH   ; and
therefore  (ex aquo  pertnrhatfy AF   is to CD   as CD   to BG.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Hence  if two  tangents FG,  PQ,  meet  two  parallel tangents AF,
BG  in F and  G, P and  Q,, and  cut  one  the  other  in O; AF  (ex cequo  per-
tnrbot,  ) will  be to BQ  as AP  to BG,  and  by division,  as FP  to GQ,  and
therefore  as FO   to OG.

   cut  off as  that part  of the other conterminous  side which  is intercepted

   Let  the four  sides ML,  IK, KL,  MI,
 of the parallelogram  ML JK  touch  the
 conic  section  in A, B, C,  I) ; and  let the
 fifth tangent FQ  cut  those  sides  in F,

segments KH,  MF   of  the  sides KL,
ML,  1 s/.y, that ME   is to MI  as BK   to
KQ;  and KH   to KL   as AM   to MF.
For, by Cor.  1 of the preceding Lemma, ME   is to El  as (AM  or) BK   to
BQ  ; and, by composition, ME   is to MI  as BK  to KQ.  Q.E.D.  Also
KH   is to HL   as (BK  or) AM   to AF  ; and by  division, KH   to KL   as AM
to MF.   Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Hence   if a parallelogram IKLM   described  about  a given  conic
section  is given,  the rectangle KQ  X ME,   as also  the rectangle KH  X ME
equal  thereto,  will  be given.  For, by reason  of the  similar  triangles KQH
MFE,  those  rectangles  are  equal.
   COR.  2. And   if a sixth tangent  eq  is drawn  meeting  the tangents  Kl.
MI  in q and  e, the rectangle KQ  X ME   will  be equal  to the  rectangle
K</ X Me,  and KQ   will  be  to Me  as Kq  to ME,  and  by  division   ns
Q?  to Ee.
   COR.  3. Hence,  also, if E<?, eQ,  are joined  and  bisected, and  a right  line
is drawn  through  the points  of bisection,  this right  line  will pass through
the centre  of the  conic section.  For  since  Q</  is to Ee  as KQ   to Me,  the

   Under  the  preceding  Propositions  are comprehended  those  Problems
wherein  either  the  centres  or asymptotes  of the  trajectories  are given.  For
when  points and  tangents  and  the centre  are  given,  as many  other  points
and  as many  other  tangents  are given  at an  equal  distance  on  the  other
side  of the centre.  And  an asymptote  is to be considered  as  a tangent,  ami
its  infinitely remote  extremity  (if we  may  say  so) is a  point  of contact.
Conceive  the point  of contact  of any tangent  removed  in  infinitum,  and
the tangent  will degenerate  into  an  asymptote,  and  the  constructions  of
the preceding  Problems  will  be changed  into  the  constructions  of  those
Problems  wherein  the asymptote  is given.
   After  the  trajectory  is described,  we  may
find  its axes  and  foci in this manmr.   In the

148                         THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES

                                                                   [Book   I
trary  will hajpen  if those  legs meet  in the  remotest  point L.  'Whence   ii
the centre  of the trajectory  is given,  the  axes  will  be given ; and  those  be-
ing given,  the  foci will  be readily  found.
  But  the squares  of the axes  are  one  to the
other  as KH   to LH,  and  thence  it is easy  to
describe  a trajectory  given  in  kind  through
f mr  given points.  For  if two  of the  given
points  are made  the poles C,  13, the  third  will
give  the moveable  angles PCK, PBK  ; but
those  being  given, the  circle BGKC   may  be
described.  Then,  because  the  trajectory  is
given  in kind,  the ratio  of OH   to OK,  and

and  therefore OH   itself, will  be given. About       '
the centre  O, with  the interval OH,  describe  another  circle, and  the  right
line that  touches  this  circle, and  passes  through  the concourse  of the  legs
CK,  BK,  when  the  first legs CP; BP  meet  in the fourth  given  point,  will
be the  ruler MN,  by means  of which  the  trajectory may  be  described

 ABC/'4f/ii  be made  similar  to the  figure
 w^cFGHI;  and  the  trapezium  fghi  will
 be  that which  was  required  to be  de

   For  let the two  first circles FSG, FTH
 cut one  the  other  in K  ; join PK,  Q,K,
 RK,  "K,  6K,  cK, and  produce QP   to L.
 The  angles FaK,  F6K,  FcK   at the circumferences  are the  halves  of  the
 angles FPK,  FQK,  FRK,   at the  centres, and  therefore  equal  to LPK,
 LQ.K, LRK,  the halves  of those angles.  Wherefore  the  figure PQRK   is
 iquiangular  and  similar  to the  figure «6cK,  and  consequently  ab  is to be
 res PQ,  to  Q,R,  that  is, as AB  to BC.  But  by construction,  the angles

 ''Air, /B//,/C?',  are  equal  to the  angles F«G,  F&H,  Fcl.  And  therefore

   COR.  Hence  a right  line may  be drawn  whose  parts  intercepted  in  a
given  order, between  four  right  lines given by position,  shall have  a given
proportion  among  themselves.  Let  the  angles FGH,  GHI,  be so far  in
creased  that  the right  lines FG, GH,  HI, may  lie in  directum  ; and by
constructing  the Problem  in this  case, a  right  line fghi  will  be drawn,
whose  parts fg,  gh, hi, intercepted  between  the  four  right  lines given  by

as the  lines FG,  GH,  HI, and  will  observe  the same  order among  them
selves.  But  the same  thing may  be more  readily  done  in this manner.
   Produce  AB  to K  and BD  to L,
so as BK  may  be to AB  as HI  to
GH   ; and DL  to BD   as GI  to FG;                                                    II

   Con.  1. Hence GH   is  to AS  as  the  time  in which  the body  described
the arc AP  to the  time  in which  the  body  described  the  arc between  the
vertex A  and  the perpendicular  erected  from  the focus  S upon  the  axis.

the  line GH   to the  right  line which  the body,  in the time  of  its moving
from A  to P, would  describe  with  that  velocity which  it had  in  the  ver
tex A.

the body  has  described  any  assigned  arc AP.   Join AP,  and  on  its middle

                  LEMMA   XXVIII.

 There  is no  oval figure  whose  area,  cut  off by right  lines  at pleasure,  can,
   be universally  found  by means  of equations  of any  number  of  finite
   terms  and  dimensions.

   Suppose  that within  the oval  any  point  is given, about  which  as  a pole
a right  line  is perpetually  revolving  with  an  uniform  motion,  while  in
that  right  line  a mov cable  point going  out from  the  pole moves  always
forward  with  a velocity  proportional  to the square  of that  right  line with
in the oval.  By  this motion  that  point  will  describe  a spiral with  infinite
circumgyrations.  Now   if a portion  of the  area  of the  oval  cut  off by that
right  line could  be found  by a finite  equation,  the  distance  of  the  point
from  the  pole, which  is proportional  to this  area, might  be found  by the
same  equation,  and  therefore  all the points  of  the  spiral might  be found
by a finite equation  also ; and  therefore  the  intersection  of  a  right  line
given  in position  with  the  spiral might  also  be found  by a finite equation.
But  every  right  line  infinitely produced  cuts  a spiral in an  infinite num
ber  of points  ; and  the equation  by which  any  one intersection  of two  lines
is found  at the same  time  exhibits  all their  intersections  by  as many  roots,
and  therefore  rises  to  as many  dimensions  as there  are  intersections.  Be

| There is no oval fi | gure wh | ose area, cut | off | by right lines at plea | sure, can, |
| be universally f | ound by | means of e | quat | ions of any number | of finite |
| terms and dimen | sions. |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Suppose that wit | hin the | oval any poi | nt | is given, about which | as a pole |
| a right line is per | petually | revolving | with | an uniform motion, | while in |
| that right line a m | ov cable | point going | out | from the pole moves | always |
| forward with a vel | ocity pr | oportional to | the | square of that right | line with |
| in the oval. By t | his motio | n that point | wil | l describe a spiral with | infinite |
| circumgyrations. | Now if | a portion of | the | area of the oval cut of | f by that |
| right line could be | found | by a finite eq | uati | on, the distance of | the point |
| from the pole, whic | h is pro | portional to | this | area, might be foun | d by the |
| same equation, and | therefor | e all the poi | nts | of the spiral might | be found |
| by a finite equation | also ; | and therefore | the | intersection of a r | ight line |

terscctions  is not  to be found  but  by an  equation  of two  dimensions,  fo
which  the other  intersection  may  be  also found.  Because  there may   b(-
four  intersections  of two  conic  sections, any  one  of them  is not  to be found
universally,  but by an  equation  of four  dimensions,  by which  they may  bi>
all found  together.  For  if those  intersections  are  severally  sought,  be
cause  the law  and  condition  of  all is the  same,  the  calculus  will  be  the
same  in every  case, and  therefore  the  conclusion  always  the  same,  which
must  therefore comprehend   all those  intersections  at once  within  itself, and
exhibit  them  all indifferently.  Hence  it is that  the  intersections  of  the
conic  se"f ions with  the curves  of the  third  order, because  they may  amount
to six, (\,me  out  together  by equations  of  six dimensions  ; and  the  inter
sections  of two  curves  of the  third  order, because  they may  amount   to nine,
come  out  together  by equations  of  nine dimensions.  If this  did  not  ne
cessarily happen,  we  might  reduce  all solid  to plane Problems,  and  those
higher  than  solid  to solid Problems.  But  here  i speak  of curves  irreduci
ble in power.  For  if the equation  by which  the curve  is defined may  bo
reduced  to a lower  power,  the curve  will  not  be one  single  curve,  but com
posed  of two,  or more,  whose  intersections  may  be severally  found  by different
calculusses.  After  the same  manner  the two  intersections  of right  lines
with  the conic  sections  come  out always  by equations  of two dimensions  ; the
three  intersections  of right  lines with  the irreducible  curves  of the  third
urder by equations  of  three  dimensions  ; the  four  intersections  of  right
lines with  the irreducible  curves  of the fourth  order, by equations  of  four
dimensions  ; and  so on  in iitfinitum.  Wherefore  the innumerable  inter
sections  of a right  line with  a spiral, since  this  is but  one  simple  curve
and  not  reducible  to more  curves,  require  equations  infinite  in   r- .imber  of
dimensions  and  roots, by which  they may  be  all exhibited  together.  For
 the law  and  calculus  of all is the same.  For  if a perpendicular  is let fall
 from  the pole upon  that  intersecting  right  line, and  that  perpendicular
 together  with  the intersecting  line revolves  about  the  pole, the  intersec
 tions  of  the  spiral will mutually  pass  the  one  into  the  other ; and  that
 which  was  first  or  nearest,  after  one  revolution,  will  be  the  second  ; after
 two,  the  third ; and  so  on  : nor  will  the  equation  in  the mean  time  be
changed  but  as the magnitudes  of  those quantities  are  changed,  by which
 the position  of the intersecting  line  is determined.  Wherefore  since  those
 quantities  after every  revolution  return  to their  first magnitudes,  the equa
 tion will  return  to  its  first form  ; and  consequently  one  and  the  same
 equation  will exhibit  all the intersections,  and  will  therefore  have  an  infi
 nite number  of roots, by which  they may  be  all exhibited.  And  therefore
 the intersection  of  a right  line with  a spiral cannot  be universally  found by
 any  finite equation  ; and  of consequence  there  is no  oval  figure whose  area,
 cut  off by right  lines  at  pleasure,  can  be  universally  exhibited  by an^
 such  equation.

  By  the same  argument,  if the interval  of the  pole and  point by[BOOKwhich1
the spiral  is described  is taken  proportional  to that part  of the  perimeter
of the oval which  is cut  off, it may  be proved  that  the length  of  the  peri

  COR.  Hence  the  area  of an  ellipsis, described  by a  radius  drawn  from
the focus  to the moving  body,  is not  to be found  from  the  time  given  by a
finite equation  ; and  therefore  cannot  be  determined  by  the description  ol
curves  geometrically  rational.  Those  curves  I call geometrically  rational,
all the  points  whereof  may  be determined  by lengths  that  are  definable
by equations ; that  is, by the complicated  ratios  of lengths.  Other  curves
(such  as  spirals, quadratrixes,  and  cycloids)  I call geometrically  irrational.
For  the lengths  which  are  or  are  not  as number  to number  (according  to
the  tenth  Book  of Elements)  are  arithmetically  rational  or  irrational.
And  therefore  I cut  off an  area  of an  ellipsis proportional  to  the  time  in
which  it is described  by  a curve  geometrically  irrational,  in the following
manner.

   But  since  the description  of this curve
is difficult, a  solution  by approximation
will  be preferable.  First, then,  let there
be found  a certain  angle B  which  may
be  to  an  angle  of 57,29578  degrees,
which  an  arc equal  to the radius  subtends,
as SH,  the distance  of  the  foci, to AB,
the diameter  of the ellipsis.  Secondly,  a certain  length  L, which  may  be  to
the radius  in the same  ratio inversely.  And  these being found,  the Problem
may  be solved  by the  following  analysis.  By  any  construction  (or  even
by conjecture),  suppose  we  know  P the  place  of the  body near  its  true
 place jo. Then  letting  fall on  the  axis  of the  ellipsis the  ordinate PR
from  the proportion  of the diameters  of  the  ellipsis, the  ordinate RQ   of
 the circumscribed  circle AQB   will  be given  ; which  ordinate  is the  sine  of
 the angle AOQ,  supposing AO   to be the  radius, and  also  cuts  the  ellipsis
 in P.   It will  .be sufficient  if that angle  is found  by a  rude  calculus  in
numbers  near  the truth.  Suppose  we  also know  the angle proportional  to
the  time,  that  is, which  is to four  right  a iules  as  the  time  in which   tlie
body  described  the  arc  A/?, to the time  of one  revolution  in  the  ellipsis.
Let  this angle  be N.  Then  take  an  angle D, which  may  be  to the  angle
B  as the  sine  of the  angle AOQ   to the radius ; and  an  angle E  which
may  be  to the  angle N — AOQ  -fD  as the length L  to the same  length
 L diminished  by the  cosine  of the  angle AOQ,  when  that  angle  is less
than  a  right  angle, or  increased  thereby when  greater.  In  the  next
 place, take  an  angle F  that may  be to the angle B  as  the sine  of the angle
 1OQ   H- E  to the  radius, and  an  angle G, that may  be to the  angle N-
AOQ  —  E  -f F  as the length L  to the same  length L  diminished  by the
cosine  of  the angle AOQ  +  E, when  that  angle  is less than  a right  angle,
 or increased  thereby when  greater.  For  the  third  time  take  an  angle H,
 that may  be  to the angle B  as the  sine  of the angle AOQ    f- E  4- G  to the

take  the angle AOy  equal  to  the  angle AOQ   -f- E  4- G +  I -\-} &c.  and
from  its cosine  Or  and  the ordinatejor,  which  is to its sine  qr as the lesser
axis  of the  ellipsis  to the  greater,   \\ e shall  have p the  correct  place of  the
body. When   the  angle N —  AOQ,  -f D  happens  to be  negative,  the
sign  -|- of the angle E  must  be every  where  changed  into —  , and  the sign —
into +.  And  the same  thing  is to be understood  of the signs  of the angles
G  and  I, when  the  angles N —  AOQ  —  E  -f F, and  N — AOQ  —  E —
G + H  come  out negative.  But  the  infinite  series AOQ   -f- E  -f- G  -|- I +,
&c.  converges  so very  fast, that  it will  be  scarcely  ever  needful  to  pro
ceed  beyond  the  second  term E.  And  the  calculus  is founded  upon
this Theorem,  that  the  area APS   is as  the  difference  between  the  arc
AQ  and  the right  line  let fall from  the focus  S perpendicularly  upon  the
radius OQ.
   And  by  a calculus  not  unlike,  the Problem
is solved  in the hyperbola.  Let  its centre  be
O, its vertex  A,  its focus  S, and  asymptote
OK  ; and  suppose  the quantity  of the area  to
be cut  off is known,  as being  proportional  to
the time.  Let  that  be  A, and  by conjecture
suppose  we know  the position  of  a  rij;ht  i ne
SP,  that  cuts  off an  area APS  near  the truth.
Join OP,  and  from  A  and  P  to the asymptote °      T A      S
draw  AI, PK  parallel  to the other asymptote  ; and  by the  table  of loga
rithms  the area AIKP   will be  given, and  equal  thereto  the  area OPA,
which  subducted  from  the triangle OPS,  will  leave  the  area  cut  off APS.
And  by applying  2 APS  —  2 A, or 2 A —  2 A PS, the  double  difference  of
the  area A  that  was  to be cut  off, and  the area APS  that  is cut  off, to the
line SN  that  is let fall from  the  focus  S, perpendicular  upon  the tangent
TP,  we  shall have  the  length  of  the chord PQ.  Which  chord PQ   is to
be  inscribed  between  A  and  P, if the  area APS  that  is cut  off  be greater
than  the  area A  that  was  to be cut  off, but towards  the contrary  side  of the
point  P, if otherwise  : and  the point Q  will be the place of  the body  more
accurately.  And  by  repeating  the computation  the  place may  be found
perpetually  to greater  and  greater  accuracy.
  And  by  such  computations  we  have  a  general
analytical  resolution  of the Problem.  But  the par
ticular  calculus  that  follows  is better  fitted  for  as
tronomical  purposes.  Supposing  AO,  OB, OD,  to
be the semi-axis  of the  ellipsis, and L  its latus  rec
tum,  and D  the difference  betwixt  the  lesser  semi-

| AOQ -f- E | + G, when t | hat ang | le is | less t | han a right angle, or | increased |

| &c. converge | s so very fa | st, tha | t it w | ill be | scarcely ever needful | to pro |

axis OD,  and  -,L the half  of the latus rectum  : let an angle Y  be found,  whose
sine may  be  to the radius  as  the  rectangle  under  that  difference  J), and
AO  4- OD  the  half sum  of the  axes  to the square  of the greater  axis AB.
Find  also  an  angle  Z, whose  sine may  be  to the radius  as the  double  rec
tangle under  the distance  of the  foci SH  and  that  difference D  to  triple
the square  of half  the greater  semi-axis AO.  Those  angles  being  once
found,  the place  of the body may  be thus determined.  Take  the angle T
proportional  to the time  in which  the  arc BP  was  described,  or equal  to
what  is called  the mean  motion  ; and  an  angle V  the  first equation  of  thr
mean  motion  to the  angle  Y, the  greatest  first equation,  as  the  sine  of
double  the angle T  is to the radius  ; and  an angle X,  the second  equation,
to the angle  Z, the second  greatest  equation,  as the cube  of the  sine  of the
angle T  is to the cube  of the radius.  Then  take  the angle BHP   the mean
motion  equated  equal  to T  + X  +  V,  the sum  of  the angles T,  V.  X,
if the angle T  is less than  a  right angle;  or  equal  to T  +  X —  V,  the
difference  of  the same,  if that  angle T  is greater  than  one  and  less than
two  right angles ; and  if HP  meets  the  ellipsis  in P, draw  SP,  and  it will
cut  off the  area BSP  nearly  proportional  to the  time.
   This  practice  seems  to be expeditious  enough,  because  the angles V  and
X,  taken  in second  minutes,  if you  please, being  very  small,  it will  be suf
ficient  to  find two  or  three  of  their  first figures.  But  it is likewise

sufficiently  accurate  to answer  to  the  theory  of  the  planet's  motions.
For  even  in the  orbit of  Mars,  where  the greatest  equation  of  the  centre
amounts  to ten  degrees,  the  error  will  scarcely  exceed  one second.  But
when  the  angle  of the mean  motion  equated BHP   is found,  the angle  oi
the  true  motion  BSP,  and  the distance  SP,  are  readily  had  by  the known
methods.
   And  so far concerning  the motion  of bodies  in curve  lines.  But  it mav
also come  to pass  that  a moving  body  shall  ascend  or descend  in  a right
line : and  I shall now  go  on  to  explain what  belongs  to such  kind  of
motions.

with  the axis;  and  drawing  DS,  PS,  the  area ASD   will c
be proportional  to  the  area ASP,  and  therefore  also  to
the time.  The  axis AB  still reaiaining  the same,  let the
breadth  of the  ellipsis be  perpetually  diminished,  and  s
the area ASD  will always  remain  proportional  to  the
time.  Suppose  that breadth  to be diminished   in, in fruit um  ; and  the  orbit
APB  in  that  case  coinciding  with  the  axis AB,  and  the  focus  S with  the

extreme  point  of the  axis  B, the body  will descend  in the right  line  AC1.

the area SP/B  is proportional  to the  time  in which
the body  P  will move  through  the  arc P/B.  the  area

the  latus rectum  of the hyperbola RPB   be diminished

The  tilings  above  found  being  supposed.  I say,  thai  the, velocity  of a Jai
  ling  body  in any  place C  is  to the  velocity of a body, describing  a
   circle about  the centre  B  at  the distance  BC,  in, the subduplicate  ratio
   of AC,  the distance  of the body from  the remoter  vertex A  of the  circle
   or rectangular  hyperbola,  to iAB,  the principal  semi-diameter  of  the

   Let AB,  the common  dia
meter  of both  figures RPB,
DEB,  be bisected  in O;  and
draw  the right  line PT  that
may  touch  the  figure RPB
in P, and  likewise  cut  that
common  diameter  AB  (pro
duced,  if need  be) in T;  and
let SY  be perpendicular  to
this  line, and BQ   to this di
ameter,  and  suppose  the latus
rectum  of the  figure RPB   to
be L.  Prom  Cor.  9, Prop.
XVI,  it is manifest  that  the
velocity  of a  body, moving                           o--
in the  line RPB  about  the
centre  S, in  any  place P,  is
to the velocity  of a body  describing  a circle about  the same  centre,  at the
distance  SP,  in the subduplicate  ratio  of  the  rectangle £L  X  SP  to SY2
Por  by the properties  of the  conic  sections ACB   is to CP2  as 2AO   to L.

   For  suppose  a body  C  in the smallest moment  of  time  describes  in fal

ing about  the centre  S  in the  circle OK/r,  describes  the arc KA:.  Erect  the

SK.  SA*; and  draw  Del meeting  the  axis AS  in T, and  thereon  let fall  the
perpendicular  SY.
  CASE  1.  If the  figure DES   is a circle,  or  a rectangular  hyperbola,  bisect
its transverse  diameter  AS  in O, and  SO  will  be  half  the  latus  rectum.
And  because TC   is to TD   as Cc  to Dd,  and TD   to TS  as CD  to  S Y  ;
ex aquo TC  will  be  to TS  as CD  X  Cc  to SY  X Dd.  But  (by Cor.  1,
Prop. XXXIII)  TC   is to TS  as AC  to AO;   to wit, if in  the coalescence
of the points D, d, the ultimate  ratios  of  the  lines  are taken.  Wherefore
AC   is to AO  or SK  as CD  X  Cc  to S Y  X Vd,   Farther,  the velocity  of
the descending  body  in C  IF, to  the velocity  of  a body  describing  a circle
about  the centre  S, at the interval  SC,  in the subduplicate  ratio  of AC   to

AO  or SK  (by Pi-op. XXXIII)  ; and  this velocity  is to  the velocity  of  a
body  describing  the  circle OKA:  in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of SK  to SC
(by Cor.  6, Prop  IV) ; and,  ex  aqnnj  the  first velocity  to the  last, that  is,
the  little line Cc  to the  arc  K/r, in the subduplicate  ratio  of AC  to SC,
that  is, in the  ratio  of AC   to CD.  Wherefore  CD  X  Cc  is equal  to AC

X  KA*, and  consequently  AC  to SK  as AC  X  KA:  to SY  X  IW.  and
thence SK  X  KA:  equal  to SY  X  Drf, and iSK  X  KA:  equal  to £SY  X  DC/,
that  is, the  area  KSA*  equal  to the area SDrf.  Therefore  in every moment
of time  two  equal  particles, KSA"  and  SDrf,  of  areas  are  generated,  which,
if their magnitude   is diminished,  and  their number  increased  in  iiifinif't-w,
obtain  the  ratio  cf equality,  and  consequently  (by Cor. Lem.  IV), the whole
areas  together  generated  are always  equal.  Q..E.D.
  CASE  2. But  if the  figure DES   is a
parabola, we  shall  find, as  above. CD  X
Cc  to SY  X  Df/  as TC  to TS,  that  is,
as 2 to 1 ; and  that  therefore |CD  X  Cc
is equal  to i SY  X Vd.  But  the  veloc
ity of  the  falling body  in C  is equal  to
the velocity  writh which  a  circle may  be
uniformly  described  at  the  interval 4SC

(byto theProp"velocityXXXIV).with  whichAnd athiscirclevelocitymay
be described  with  the radius SK,  that  is,

the  little  line Cc  to  the  arc  KA',  is (by
Cor.  6, Prop.  IV) in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of SK  to iSC ; that  is, in the
ratio  of SK  to *CD.  Wherefore  iSK  X  KA:  is equal  to 4CD  X  Cc, and

therefore  equal  to £SY  X  T)d ; that  is, the area  KSA*  is equal  to the  area
SIW,  as above.  Q.E.D.

        PROPOSITION   XXXVIII.   THEOREM   XII.

Supposing  that  the  centripetal  force  is proportional  to the altitude  or
   distance  of places from  the  centre, I say,  that  the times  and  velocities
    of falling  bodies, and  the spaces  which  they describe,  are  respectively
  proportional  to the  arcs, and  the right and  versed  sines  of the  arcs.
   Suppose  the body  to  fall from  any  place A  in  the      A.
right  line AS  ; and  about  the  centre  of  force  S, with
the interval  AS,  describe  the quadrant  of  a circle AE  ;
and  let CD  be  the right  sine of any  arc AD  ; and  the
body A  will in  the  time  AD   in  falling  describe  the
space AC,  and  in  the  place  C  will  acquire  the  ve
locity CD.
   This  is demonstrated  the same  way  from  Prop. X,  as Prop. XXX11   was
demonstrated  from  Prop.  XI.
   COR.  1. Hence  the times  are  equal  in which  one  body  falling from  the
place A  arrives  at the centre  S, and  another  body revolving  describes  the
quadrantal  arc ADE.
   COR.  2. Wherefore   all the times  are  equal  in which  bodies  falling from
whatsoever  places  arrive  at the centre.  For  all the  periodic  times  of  re
volving  bodies  are  equal  (by Cor.  3; Prop.  IV).

       PROPOSITION   XXXIX.    PROBLEM    XXVIT.

Supposing  a  centripetal  force  of any  kind, and  granting  the quadra-
   tnres  of curvilinear  figures  ;  it is required  to find  the velocity  of a bod)/,
  ascending  or descending  in  a right  line, in  the several  places through
  which   it passes  ;  as  also  the time  in which  it will  arrive  at any  place  :
  and  vice  versa.

  Suppose  the body E  to  fall from  any  place
A  in the right  line AD  EC  ; and  from  its place
E imagine  a perpendicular EG  always  erected
proportional  to  the  centripetal  force  in  that

whose  square  is equal  to the area ABGE;   is as  the velocity  of the descend
ing body,  the  area  itself  will  be  as the square  of  that  velocity  ; that  is, if
for the  velocities  in D  and E  we  write  V  and  V +  I, the  area ABFD   will
be as VY, and  the  area ABGE   as YY  +  2VI  -f II; and  by division,  the

area DFGE   as  2 VI  -f LI, and  therefore    ^      will  be   as --  ^r

the force  will  be  as the increment  I of  the velocity  directly  and  the time

in like manner  the  area PQRD   to the  area

are  as the generating  forces,  that  is, as the  or-

therefore,  ex  aq-uo,  the whole  areas ABFD,  PQRD   will be  to one  another

expressed  by the equal  lineoke DE  and  IN ; and  let the  force
IN  (by Cor.  2 of  the Laws  of Motion)  be  resolved  into  two

others, NT  and IT.   rl hen  the  force NT  acting  in  the  direction
line NT  perpendicular  to the path ITK  of  the body  will  not  at  all affect
or change  the  velocity  of the  body  in  that  path, but  only draw  it aside
from  a rectilinear  course,  and make  it deflect  perpetually  from  the tangent
of the  orbit, and  proceed  in  the  curvilinear  path ITK/j.  That  whole
force, therefore,  will  be spent  in producing  this effect:  but  the  other  force
IT, acting  in the  direction  of the course  of  the body,  will  be  all employed
in accelerating  it, and  in the  least given  time  will produce  an  acceleration
proportional  to itself.  Therefore  the accelerations  of the bodies  in D  and
I, produced  in equal  times,  are  as  the  lines DE,  IT  (if we  take  the  first
ratios  of the nascent  lines DE,  IN, IK, IT, NT)  ; and  in unequal  times  as
those  lines and  the  times conjunctly.  But  the times  in which DE  and IK
are  described,  are, by reason  of the  equal  velocities  (in D  and  I) as  the
spaces  described DE  and  IK, and  therefore  the accelerations  in the course
of the bodies  through  the  lines DE  and  IK  are  as DE  and  IT, and DE
and IK  conjunctly ; that  is, as the square  of DE   to the rectangle  IT  into
IK.  But  the  rectangle IT  X  IK  is equal  to  the  square  of  IN,  that  is,
equal  to the square  of DE  ; and  therefore  the  accelerations  generated  in
the passage  of the bodies  from  D  and  I to E  and K  are equal.  Therefore
the velocities  of  the holies  in E  and K  are  also  equal,  and  by the same
reasoning  they  will always  be found  equal  in any  subsequent  equal  dis
tances.  Q..E.D.

   By  the same  reasoning,  bodies  of equal  velocities  and  equal  distances
 from  the  centre  will  be equally  retarded  in their  ascent  to equal  distances.
 Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Therefore  if a body  either  oscillates by hanging  to  a string,  or
 by any  polished  and  perfectly smooth  impediment   is forced  to move  in  a
 curve  line ; and  another  body  ascends  or descends  in  a right  line, and  their
 velocities  be equal  at any  one  equal  altitude,  their  velocities  will  be  also
 equal  at  all other  equal  altitudes.  For  by the  string  of  the  pendulous
 body,  or by the impediment  of  a vessel  perfectly  smooth,  the same  thing
 will  be  effected  as by  the  transverse  force NT.  The  body  is neither
accelerated  nor  retarded  by  it, but  only  is obliged  to leave  its rectilinear
course.
   COR.  2. Suppose  the quantity  P  to be  the  greatest  distance  from  the
 centre  to which  a body  can  ascend, whether  it be oscillating,  or  revolving
in a trajectory,  and  so the same  projected upwards  from  any  point  of  a
trajectory  with  the velocity  it has  in that point.  Let  the  quantity  A  be
the distance  of the body from  the  centre  in any  other  point  of the  orbit  ; and
let the centripetal  force  be always  as the power  An —  ', of the quantity  A, the
index  of which  power  n —  1 is any number  n diminished  by unity.  Then

the velocity  in every  altitude  A  will be as  v/ P11 —  A", and  therefore  will
be given.  For  by Prop. XXXIX,   the velocity  of a body ascending  and

descending  in  a right  line  is in  tha't very  ratio.

Supposing   a centripetal  force  of any  kind, and  granting  the quadra

CR  there  be drawn  the  right  line CP,   Q-
equal  to the  abscissa CT,  making  an  angle VCP  proportional  to the sector
VCR  ; and  if a  centripetal  force,  reciprocally  proportional  to  the cubes
of the distances  of the  places from  the  centre,  tends  to the  centre C ; and
from  the  place V  there  sets  out  a body  with  a  just velocity  in  the  direc

in a trajectory  VPQ,,  which  the point P  will always  touch  ; and  therefore
if the conic  section  VI\ S be an hyberbola,  the body  will descend  to the  cen
tre ; but  if  it be an  ellipsis,  it will ascend  perpetually,  and  go farther  and
farther  off in infinilum.  And,  on  the contrary,  if a body endued  with  any
velocity  goes  off from  the place V, and  according  as  it begins  either  to de
scend  obliquely  to the  centre,  or ascends  obliquely  from  it, the  figure VRS
be either  an hyperbola  or an  ellipsis, the  trajectory may  be found  by increas
ing  or diminishing  the angle VCP   in  a given ratio.  And  the  centripetal
force becoming  centrifugal,  the body  will ascend  obliquely  in the trajectory
VPQ,  which   is found  by taking  the angle VCP  proportional  to  the  elliptic
sector VRC,  and  the length CP  equal  to the length CT,  as before.  All  these
things  follow  from  the foregoing  Proposition,  by the quadrature  of a certain

that  the increments  or decrements  of

body P  acquires  from  the  line PC,  and mr  is to kr  as the  angle  VC/?  to
the angle VCP,  that  is, as the  transverse  motion  of  the body p  to  the
transverse  motion  of the body  P, it is manifest  that  the body  p,  at the  ex
piration  of that  time,  will  be found  in the place m.  These  things  will  be
so, if the  bodies  jo and  P  are  equally moved  in the  directions  of the  lines
pC  and  PC,  and  are  therefore  urged  with  equal  forces  in those  directions.
I: ut  if we  take  an  angle pCn  that  is to the angle pCk  as  the  angle  VGj0
to the angle VCP,  and nC  be equal  to kG,  in that  case  the body  p  at the
expiration  of the time  will  really  be in  n ; and  is therefore  urged  with  a
greater  force  than  the body  P, if the angle nCp  is greater  than  the  angle
kCp,  that  is, if the  orbit npk, move  either  in  cmiseqnentia,  or in  antece-
denticij with  a celerity  greater  than  the double  of that  with  which  the  line
CP  moves  in conseqnentia  ; and  with  a less force  if the  orbit moves  slower
in antecedent-la.  And  ihj  difference  of the  forces  will be  as the  interval
mn  of the places through  which  the body  would  be carried  by the action  of
that  difference  in that given  space  of time.  About  the  centre  C  with  the

square  of the  altitude pC.  But,  moreover,  mt  is directly  as |//z/, that  is, as
the  altitude pC.  These  are  the  first ratios  of the nascent  lines  ; and hence

proportional  thereto,  are  reciprocally  as  the  cube  of the  altitude pC.

from  R  to K,  in the same  time  that  the body P  in an immovable  orb  de

         PROPOSITION   XLV.   PROBLEM  XXXL

 To  find  the motion  of the apsides  in  orbits approaching  very  near  to
                                              circles.
   This  problem  is solved  arithmetically  by reducing  the  orbit, which  a
 body revolving  in  a movable  ellipsis  (as in  Cor.  2  and  3  of  the  above
 Prop.)  describes  in an immovable  plane, to  the  figure  of the  orbit  whose
 apsides  are  required  ; and  then  seeking  the apsides  of the  orbit which  that
 body  describes  in an immovable  plane.  But  orbits  acquire  the same  figure,
 if the centripetal  forces  with  which  they are  described, compared  between
 themselves,  are made  proportional  at equal altitudes.  Let  the point V  be
 the highest  apsis, and  write T  for  the greatest  altitude  CV, A  for any  other
 altitude CP  or  C/?, and X  for  the  difference  of  the  altitudes C V —  CP   :
 and  the  force  writh which  a body moves  in an  ellipsis revolving  about  its
                                                                                            •p -p       T? C* f ^      T? F* F

         FFA  + RGG  — RFF       ,
 that  is  as,          A-^ —           , by substituting  T —  X  for A,  will  be-
        RGG  — RFF  + TFF  — FFX
 come  as                   -p —             .  In  like manner  any  other  cen

 tripetal  force  is to be reduced  to a fraction  whose  denominator   is A3, and
 the numerators  are  to be made  analogous  by collating  together  the homo
 logous terms.  This  will  be made  plainer by Examples.
   EXAMPLE   1.   Let   us  suppose   the   centripetal    force   to  be  uniform,
and therefore  as —3 or, writing T — X for A in the  numerator,  as
 T3 — 3TTX  + 3TXX  —  X3
  —           —         — =-.    Ihen  collating  together  the  correspon-
                  A3
 dent  terms  of the numerators,  that  is, those  that  consist  of given  quantities,

 with  those  of given  quantities,  and  'those  of quantities  not given  with  those
  of quantities  not  given,A3 it will become RGG  —  RFF    -f- TFF   to T3  as —
 FFX   to 3TTX   -f 3TXX  —  X3,  or  as — FF   to — 3TT  + 3TX  —  XX.
 Now  since  the  orbit  is supposed  extremely  near  to  a circle, let  it coincide
  with  a circle ; and  because  in that  case R  and T  become  equal, and X   is
  infinitely diminished,  the  last ratios  will  be, as RGG   to T2, so —  FF   to —
 3TT,  or  as GG  to TT,  so FF  to 3TT;  and  again,  as GG   to FF,  so TT
  to 3TT,  that  is, as 1 to 3 ; and  therefore  G  is to F, that  is, the angle VC/?
  to the angle VCP,  as 1 to v/3.  Therefore  since  the body,  in an immovable

 comes  to pass by reason  of  the  likeness  of  this  orbit  which  a body  acted

 not  universally,  indeed,  but  then  only when  they approach  very  near  to  a
 circular  figure.  A  body,  therefore  revolving  with  an  uniform 180centripetal

 force  in an  orbit nearly  circular,  will always  describe  an angle  of — »  deg/,  or

 103  deg., 55  m., 23  sec., at the centre;  moving  from  the upper  apsis to  the
 lower  apsis when  it has  once  described  that  angle, and  thence  returning  to
 the upper  apsis when  it has  described  that  angle again ; and  so  on  in  in-

 with  the terms  of the  other numerator  RGG  — RFF  + TFF  — FFX,   it


 becomes  as RGG  — RFF   4- TFF   to Tn,  so —  FF   to —  ?/.Tn— r + ?~^

  is, as 1 to  n ; and  therefore  G  is to F, that  is the angle VCp  to the angle
 VCP,  as 1 to ^/n.  Therefore  since  the  angle VCP,  described  in  the  de
 scent  of the body  from  the  upper  apsis  to the lower  apsis in an  ellipsis,  is
 of 180  deg., the angle  VC/?,  described  in the  descent  of the  body from  the

 arrive  at the lower  apsis, and having  performed  another  fourth  part,  will
 arrive  at the upper  apsis, and  so on by turns  in infiuitum.  This  appears
 also from  Prop. X.  For  a body  acted  on by this centripetal  force  will  re
 volve  in an immovable   ellipsis, whose  centre  is the centre  of force.  If the

 centripetal  force  is reciprocally  as  the distance,  that  is, directly  as —  or —

 volving  with  suchv/2  a force, will by  a perpetual  repetition  of this angle, move
 alternately  from  the upper  to the lower  and from  the  lower  to  the  upper

angle VC/? between  the same  apsides  in an  orbit which  a body  describes

more  difficult cases.  The  quantity  to which  the  centripetal  force  is pro
portional  must  always  be resolved  into  a converging  series whose  denomi

nator  is A*.  Then  the given  part  of  the numerator  arising from  that
operation  is to be supposed  in the same  ratio  to that  part  of it which  is not
given,  as  the given  part  of this numerator  RGG  —  RFF   -f TFF  —  FFX.
is to that  part of  the same  numerator  which  is not  given.  And  taking
away  the superfluous  quantities, and  writing  unity  for T, the  proportion
of G  to F  is obtained.

   COR.  1 . Hence  if the centripetal  force  be  as any  power  of the  altitude,
that power  may  be found  from  the motion  of the  apsides ; and  so  contra
riwise.  That  is, if the whole  angular  motion,  with  which  the body  returns
to the same  apsis, be to the angular  motion  of one  revolution,  or 360  deg.,
MS any number   as m  to another  as  n, and  the  altitude  called A ; the  force

will be  as the power  A   HSiinn —  3 of the altitude A;  the index  of which  power  is

   - —   3.   This  appears by the second  example.    Hence  it is plain  that

the  force  in  its recess from  the  centre  cannot  decrease  in  a greater  than  a
triplicate  ratio  of  the altitude.  A  body  revolving  with  such  a force, and
parting  from  the  apsis,  if it once  begins  to descend,  can  never  arrive  at the
lower  apsis  or least  altitude,  but  will descend  to the  centre, describing  the
curve  line treated  of in Cor.  3, Prop. XLL   But  if it should,  at  its part
ing from  the lower  apsis, begin  to ascend  never  so  little, it will  ascend  in
irtfimtifm, and  never  come  to the upper  apsis ; but  will describe  the  curve
line spoken  of in the same  Cor., and  Cor.  6, Prop. XLIV.   So  that  where
the  force  in  its recess from  the centre  decreases  in  a greater  than  a  tripli
cate  ratio  of the  altitude,  the body  at its parting  from  the  apsis, will either

 used  to consider  the ascent  and  descent  of such  bodies, not  only in  a  per

and  for the same  reason  we  are  to consider  in  this  place  the motions  of
 bodies  tending  to centres  by means  of any  forces  whatsoever,  when  those
bodies move  in  eccentrical  planes.  These  planes  are  supposed  to be
perfectly smooth  and  polished,  so  as not  to retard  the motion  of  the bodies
in the least.  Moreover,  in these demonstrations,  instead  of the planes upon
which  those  bodies  roll  or  slide, and  which  are therefore  tangent  planes  to
 the  bodies,  I shall  use  planes  parallel  to them,  in which  the  centres  of  the
 bodies  move,  and  by that motion  describe  orbits.  And  by the same  method
 I afterwards  determine  the motions  of bodies  performer1  in curve  superficies.

we  take SV  proportional  to the centripetal
force  with  which  the body  is attracted  to
wards  the centre  S, and  draw VT  parallel
to CQ,  and meeting  SC  in T  ; then  will  the  force SV  be resolved  into
two  (by Cor.  2, of the Laws  of Motion),  the  force ST,  and  the  force TV  ; of
which  ST  aMracting  the body  in the direction  of a  line  perpendicular  to
that  plane, does  not  at all change  its motion  in  that plane.  But  the action

t icreftre  causes  the body  to move  in  this plane  in  the same  manner  as  if
the force  S F were  taken  away,  and  the body  were  to  revolve  in free space
about  the centre C by means  of the force TV  alone.  But  there  being given
the centripetal  force TV  with  which  the  body  Q, revolves  in  free  space
about  the given  centre  C, there  is given  (by Prop. XLII)  the  trajectory
PQ.R  which  the body  describes ; the  place  Q,, in which  the body  will  be
found  at any  given  time ; and,  lastly, the velocity  of the body  in that  place

 SV, with  which  the body  Q, revolving  in any  plane PQ,R  is attracted  to

 SQ,, TV  and  CQ,  are  proportional,  the  force TV  with  which  the body  is
 attracted  towards  the given  point C  in the plane  of the  orbit  is as the  dis

 equal  to the  forces with  which  the same  bodies  are  attract-ed  every  way  to

  The  ascent  and  descent  of bodies  in curve  superficies  has  a near  relation
to these motions  we have  been speaking  of.  Imagine  curve  lines  to be de
scribed  on  any  plane, and  to revolve  about  any given  axes  passing  through
the centre  of force, and by that  revolution  to describe  curve  superficies  ; and
that  the bodies move  in such  sort  that  their centres may  be always  found
m  those superficies.  If those  bodies  reciprocate  to and  fro with  an oblique
ascent  and  descent,  their motions  will be performed  in planes passing through
tiie axis, and  therefore  in the curve  lines, by whose  revolution  those  curve
superficies  were  generated.  In those  cases, therefore,  it will  be sufficient  to
consider  thp motion  in those  curve  lines.

pendicular  AR,  the upper  part  of the thread AP  may  be  applied  to  that
semi-cycloid APS  towards  which  the motion  tends, and  fold  itself round
that  curve  line, as  if it were  some  solid  obstacle,  the remaining  part  of the
same  thread PT  which  has  not  yet  touched  the  semi-cycloid  continuing
straight.  Then  will  the weight T  oscillate  in  the given  cycloid QRS.
Q.E.F.
   For  let the  thread PT  meet  the cycloid QRS   in T, and  the  circle QOS
m  V, and  let 0V  be drawn  j and  to the  rectilinear  part of the  thread PT
from  the extreme  points P  and T  let there  be  erected  the  perpendiculars
BP,  T W, meeting  the right  line CV  in B  and W.   It is evident, from  the
construction  and  generation  of the similar  figures AS, SR,  that  those  per
pendiculars  PB,  TVV,  cut  off from  CV  the lengths  VB, VVV  equal  the
diameters  of the wheels  OA, OR.  Therefore  TP   is to VP  (which  is dou
ble  the  sine of  the angle VBP  when  ^BV  is radius)  as BYV  to BV,  or AO
-f-OR  to AO,  that  is (since CA  and CO, CO  and CR;  and by division AO
and OR   are  proportional),  as CA  + CO  to CA,  or, if BV  be bisected  in E,
as 2CE   to CB.  Therefore  (by Cor.  1, Prop. XLIX),  the length  of  the
rectilinear  part  of the thread PT   is always  equal  to  the  arc  of the cycloid
PS, and  the whole  thread APT   is always  equal  to the  half  of the cycloid
APS,  that  is (by Cor.  2, Prop. XLIX),  to  the length AR.  And  there
fore contrariwise,  if the string remain  always  equal  to the length AR,  the
point T  will always  move  in the given  cycloid QRS.  Q.E.D.
  COR.  The  string AR   is equal  to the semi-cycloid  AS,  and  therefore  has
the same  ratio  to AC  the semi-diameter  of  the exterior  globe  as  the  like
semi-cycloid  SR  has  to CO  the semi-diameter  of the  interior  globe.

          PROPOSITION    LI.  THEOREM   XVIII.

If a  centripetal  force  tending  on  all sides  to the  centre C  of a globe,  be in
   all places  as  the distance  of the place from  the  centre, and  by  this force
   alone  acting upon  it, the  body T  oscillate  (in the manner  above  de
   scribed]  in  the perimeter  of the cycloid QRS  ; / say,  that  all the  oscil
   lations, how  unequal  soever  in tfiemselves,  will  be performed  in equal
   times.
   For  upon  the tangent  T W  infinitely produced  let fall the perpendicular
CX,  and  join CT.   Because  the centripetal  force with  which  the  body T
is impelled  towards  C  is as  the  distance  CT,  let this  (by Cor.  2, of  the

body  directly from  P  stretches  the  thread  PT,  and  by the  resistance  the

3ther  part TX,  impelling  the  body  transversely  or  towards  X,  directly
accelerates  the motion  in the cycloid.  Then   it is plain that  the  accelera

                            as the length  of the  arc  of the cycloid TR.   If there
                           fore two pendulums  APT,  Apt, be unequally  drawn

                           their  accelerations  will  be always  as the arcs  to be de

                       beginning  of the motion  are  as the accelerations,  thai

described,  and  the subsequent  accelerations  proportional  to those  parts,  are
also  as the wholes,  and  so on.  Therefore  the accelerations,  and consequently
the  velocities  generated,  and  the parts described  with  those  velocities,  and
the  parts  to be described,  are always  as the wholes  ; and  therefore  the parts
to be described  preserving  a given  ratio  to each  other  will vanish  together,
that  is, the two  bodies  oscillating  will arrive  together  at the perpendicular  AR.
And  since  on  the other hand  the ascent  of the pendulums  from  the lowest  place
R  through  the same  cycloidal  arcs  with  a retrograde  motion,  is retarded  in
the several  places they  pass through  by  the same  forces by which  their  de
scent  was  accelerated  : it is plain  that  the  velocities  of their  ascent  and  de
scent through  the same  arcs  are  equal, and  consequently  performed  in equal
times  ; and,  therefore,  since  the two  parts  of the cycloid RS  and RQ  lying
on  either  side  of the perpendicular  are  similar  and  equal, the  two  pendu

forces which  act upon  the bodies  are  equal  at the  be
ginning,  and  always  proportional  to  the  spaces  to be
described TR,  LG,  and  therefore  if TR  and LG  are
equal,  are  also equal  in the places T  and  L,  it is plain
that  those  bodies  describe  at the beginning  equal spaces M
ST,  HL,  and  therefore  are  still acted  upon  equally, and  continue  to describe
equal spaces.  Therefore  by Prop. XXXVIII,   the time  in which  the body
describes  the  arc ST   is to the time  of one  oscillation,  as the  arc HI  the time
in which  the body H  arrives  at  L, to  the semi-periphery HKM,   the  time
in which  the body H  will come  to M.  And  the velocity  of  the pendulous
body  in the place T  is to  its velocity  in the  lowest  place  R, that  is, the
velocity  of the body H  in the  place L  to its velocity  in the place G, or the
momentary  increment  of the  line HL   to the momentary  increment  of  the
line HG   (the arcs HI, HK  increasing  with  an  equable  flux) as the ordinato

LI  to the radius GK.  or  as  v/SR2 —  Til2  to SR.   Hence,  since  in unequal
oscillations  there  are described  in equal time  arcs  proportional  to  the  en
 tire arcs  of the  oscillations,  there  are  obtained  from  the  times  given,  both
the  velocities  and  the  arcs  described  in  all the  oscillations  universally.
Which  was  first required.
   Let now  any pendulous  bodies  oscillate  in  different  cycloids  described
 within  different  globes, whose  absolute  forces  are  also  different  ; and  if the
 absolute  force  of any  globe Q.OS  be  called  V, the  accelerative  force  with
 which  the pendulum   is acted  on  in the circumference  of this  globe, when  it
 begins  to move  directly towards  its centre,  will  be  as the  distance  of  the
 pendulous  body  from  that  centre  and  the absolute  force  of the  globe  con-
 junctly,  that  is, as CO  X V.  Therefore  the  lineola HY,  which  is as  this
 accelerated  force CO  X  V, will  be described  in  a given  time  : and  if there
 be erected  the perpendicular  YZ  meeting  the circumference  in Z, the nascent
 arc HZ   will denote  that given time.  But  that  nascent  arc HZ   is in  the
 subduplicate  ratio  of the rectangle GHY,  and  therefore  as v/GH  X CO  X V
 Whence  the time  of an  entire  oscillation  in  the  cycloid Q,RS  (it being  as
 the semi-periphery HKM,   wrhich  denotes  that  entire  oscillation,  directly   :
 and  as the  arc HZ  which  in like manner  denotes  a given  time  inversely)
 will be as GH   directly and v/GH  X CO  X V  inversely ; that  is, because

 GH  and SR  are  equal, as Vnr,UU  X.  ™Vor (by Cor.  Prop.  L,) as  X/-TTVT-AO  X  —V
 Therefore  the  oscillations  in all globes and  cycloids, performed  with  what
 absolute  forces  soever,  are  in  a ratio compounded  of the subduplicate  ratio  of
 the length  of the string  directly, and  the subduplicate  ratio  of the distance
 between  the point  of suspension  and  the centre  of  the globe  inversely,  and
  the subduplicate  ratio  of the  absolute  force  of  the globe  inversely  also

   COR.  1. Hence  also  the times  of oscillating,  falling, and  revolving  bodies
may  be compared  among  themselves.  For  if the  diameter  of  the  wheel
with  which  the cycloid  is described  within  the globe  is supposed  equal  to
the semi-diameter  of the  globe, the cycloid  will become  a right  line passing
through  the centre  of the  globe, and  the  oscillation  will  be changed  into  a
descent  and  subsequent  ascent  in that  right line.  Whence  there  is given
both  the time  of the descent  from  any  place  to the  centre, and  the time  equal
to it in which  the body  revolving  uniformly  about  the  centre  of  the globe
at any  distance  describes  an  arc  of  a quadrant  For  this time  (by
Case  2) is to the time  of half  the  oscillation  in  any  cycloid  QJR.S  as 1 to

   COR.  2. Hence  also  follow  what  Sir Christopher  Wren  and  M. Huygevs
have  discovered  concerning  the vulgar  cycloid.  For  if the diameter  of the
globe  be infinitely  increased,  its sphacrical  superficies  will  be changed  into  a
plane, and  the centripetal  force  will  act uniformly  in  the direction  of lines

perpendicular  to that  plane, and  this cycloid  of our's  will become  the same
with  the common  cycloid.  But  in that  case  the length  of the  arc  of  the
cycloid between  that  plane and  the describing  point  will  become  equal  to
four  times  the versed  sine  of half  the  arc  of the  wheel  between  the same
plane and  the describing  point,  as was  discovered  by Sir Christopher  Wren.
And   a pendulum  between  two  such  cycloids  will  oscillate  in  a similar  and
equal  cycloid  in equal  times,  as M. Huygens  demonstrated.  The  descent
of heavy  bodies  also  in the time  of one  oscillation  will  be the same  as M.
Huygens  exhibited.
  The  propositions  here demonstrated  are adapted  to  the true constitution
of the Earth,  in so far  as wheels  moving  in any  of its great  circles  will  de
scribe, by the motions  of nails  fixed  in  their perimeters,  cycloids  without  the
globe ; and  pendulums,  in mines  and  deep caverns  of the Earth,  must  oscil
late in cycloids  within  the globe,  that  those  oscillations may  be performed
in equal times.  For  gravity  (as will  be shewn  in the third  book)  decreases
in  its progress  from  the  superficies  of the Earth  ; upwards  in a duplicate
ratio  of the  distances  from  the centre  of the  Earth  ; downwards  in  a sim
ple ratio  of the same.

   the forces  with  which  bodies moving  in given  curve  lines may  always

passing  through  the  centre  of force C.  Draw  TX  touching  that  curve  in

draw  the right  line YZ  perpendicular  to the tangent.
Draw  CT  meeting  that  perpendicular  in Z, and  the
centripetal  force  will  be proportional  to the right  line
TZ.   Q.E.I.
   For  if the  force  with  which  the  body  is attracted
from  T  towards  C  be expressed  by the right  line TZ
taken  proportional  to  it, that  force  will  be  resolved
into  two  forces TY,  YZ,  of which YZ  drawing  the
body  in the direction  of the length  of the thread PT,
docs  not  at  all change  its motion  ; whereas  the  other
force TY  directly  accelerates  or retards  its mction  in  the  curve STRQ.
 Wherefore  since  that  force  is as the space  to be described TR,  the  acceler
ations  or retardations  of the body  in describing  two  proportional  parts  (u
greater  arid a less) of two  oscillations,  will  be always  as  those  parts, and
 therefore  will cause  those  parts  to be described  together.  But  bodies which
continually  describe  together  parts proportional  to  the wholes,  will describe
 the wholes  together  also.  Q,.E.l).
   COR.  1. Hence   if the body  T, hanging  by a rectilinear  thread
AT  from  the  centre  A, describe  the  circular  arc STRQ,,
 and  in the mean  time  be  acted  on  by any  force  tending
 downwards  with  parallel  directions, which  is to the  uni
 form  force  of gravity  as the  arc TR   to  its sine TN,  the
 times  of the  several  oscillations  will be equal.  For  because
 TZ, AR   are  parallel, the  triangles ATN, ZTY   are  similar  ; and  there
 fore TZ   will be  to AT  as TY   to TN  ; that  is, if the uniform  force  of
 gravity  be  expressed  by the given  length AT,  the  force TZ.  by which  the
 oscillations  become  isochronous,  will be  to the  force  of gravity AT,  as the
 arc TR  equal  to TY   is to TN   the  sine  of that  arc.
   COR.  2. And  therefore  in clocks,  if forces  were  impressed  by some  ma
 chine upon  the pendulum  which  preserves  the motion,  and  so compounded
 with  the  force  of gravity  that  the whole  force tending  downwards  should
 be always  as  a line produced  by applying  the rectangle  under  the  arc TR
 and  the radius AR   to  the  sine TN,  all  the  oscillations  will become

to the plane AOP,  introduce  no change  in the motion  of the body  but  in a di
rection  perpendicular  to that plane.  Therefore  its motion,  so far  as it has
the same  direction  with  the position  of the plane,  that  is, the motion  of the
point  P, by which  the projection AP  of the trajectory  is described  in that
plane,  is the same  as if the  forces TF, TH  were  taken  away,  and  the body
wei  e acted  on by the  forces FG,  HI  alone ; that  is, the same  as  ,f the body
were  to describe  in the plane AOP   the curve AP  by means  of a centripetal
force  tending  to the centre  O, and  equal  to the sum  of  the  forces FG  and
HI.  But  with  such  a force  as that  (by Prop.  1) the  area AOP   will  be de
scribed  proportional  to the time.  Q.E.D.

two  or more  centres  in any  the same  right line CO,  should  describe  in  a
free space  any  curve  line ST,  the area AOP  would  be always  proportional
to the  time.

   f 'f the motions  of bodies  tending'  to each  other  with  centripetal  forces.
   I have  hitherto  been  treating  of the attractions  of bodies  towards  an im
movable  centre;  though  very  probably  there  is no such  thing  existent  in
nature.  For  attractions  are made  towards  bodies, and  the actions  of  the
bodies  attracted  and  attracting  are always  reciprocal  and  equal, by Law  III ;
BO that  if there  are two  bodies,  neither  the  attracted  nor  the attracting body
is truly  at  rest, but  both  (by Cor.  4, of the Laws  of  Motion),  being  as  it
were  mutually  attracted,  revolve  about  a common   centre  of gravity.  And
if there  be more  bodies, which  are  either  attracted  by one  single  one  which
is attracted  by them  again,  or which  all of them,  attract  each  other mutu
ally , these  bodies  will  be  so moved  among  themselves,  as that  their common
centre  of gravity  will  either be  at  rest, or move  uniformly  forward  in  a
right line.  I shall  therefore  at  present  go  on  to treat  of the  motion  of
 bodies mutually  attracting  each  other  ; considering  the  centripetal  forces
 as attractions  ; though  perhaps  in a physical  strictness  they may  more  truly
 be called impulses.  But  these  propositions  are  to be considered  as purely
mathematical;  and  therefore,  laying  aside  all physical  considerations,  I
 make  use  of a familiar  way  of speaking,  to make  myself  the more  easily
 understood  by  a mathematical  reader.

 Two  bodies  attracting  each  other mutually  describe  similar  figures  about

round  those terms.  Therefore  the  figures  described  by the  revolution  ot
these  distances  are similar.  Q.E.D.


         PROPOSITION   LVIll.   THEOREM   XXI.

If two  bodies  attract  each  other mutually  with  forces  of any  kind, and
   in  the mean  time  revolve  about  the common   centre  of gravity  ; I say,
   that, by the same  forces,  there may  be described  round  either  body  un
  moved  ajigure  similar  and  equal  to the figures  ivhich  the  bodies  so
  moving  describe  round  each  other mutually.
   Let  the bodies S  and  P  revolve  about  their common  centre  of gravity
C, proceeding  from  S to T, and  from  P  to  Q,.   From  the given  point  s  lot





there  be continually  drawn  sp,  sq, equal and  parallel  to SP, TQ,  ; and  the
;urve pqv,  which  the point p describes  in its revolution  round  the immovable

point  s, will  be similar  and  equal  to the curves  which  the  bodies  S and  P'
describe  about  each  other mutually  ; and  therefore, by Theor.  XX,  similar
to the curves ST  and PQ,V  which  the same  bodies  describe  about  their

common  centre  of gravity  C  • and  that  because  the proportions  of the  lines
SC.  CP,  and SP  or  sp, to each  other,  are  given.
  CASE  1. The  common  centre  of gravity  C (by Cor.  4, of the Laws  of Mo
tion)  is either  at  rest, or moves  uniformly  in  a right line.  Let  us  first
suppose  it at rest, and  in s and p  let there  be  placed  two  bodies,  one im
movable  in s, the  other movable   in p, similar  and  equal  to the bodies  S arid
P.  Then  let the right  lines PR  and pr  touch  the curves  PQ,  and pq  ki P

CPRQ,  sprq  are  similar, RQ,  will  be to rq  as CP  to  sp, and  therefore  in  a
given ratio.  Hence  if the force  with  which  the  body  P  is attracted  to
wards  the body  S, and  by consequence  towards  the  intermediate  point  the
centre  C, were  to the  force with  which  the body p is attracted  towards  the
Centre  5. in  the same  given  ratio, these  forces would  in equal  times  attract

to s) would  make  the body p  revolve  in the curve  pqv,  which  would  becomr
similar  to the curve PQV,  in which  the  first force  obliges  the  body P   i(
revolve  ; and  their  revolutions  would  be completed  in  the same  timeg
But  because  those  forces  are  not  to each  other  in the  ratio  of CP   to sp, bu;
(by reason  of the similarity  and  equality  of the  bodies  S  and  s, P  and /
and  the  equality  of the  distances  SP,  sp) mutually  equal, the  bodies   ii
equal  times  will be equally drawn  from  the  tangents;  and  therefore  tLV
the body p may  be attracted  through  the greater  interval  rq, there  is  re
quired  a greater  time, which  will  be in the subduplicate  ratio  of the  inter
vals ; because, by Lemma  X,  the spaces  described  at the very beginning  ol
the motion  are in a duplicate  ratio  of the times.  Suppose,  then  the velocity
of the body p  to be  to the velocity  of the body P  in  a subduplicate  ratio  of
the distance  sp to the distance  CP,  so that  the  arcs  pq, PQ,  which  are  in a
simple  proportion  to each  other, may  be  described  in times  that  are  in  n
subduplicate  ratio  of the  distances  ; and  the  bodies  P, p, always  attracted
by equal  forces, will  describe  round  the quiescent  centres C  and  s  similar
figures PQV,  pqv,  the  latter  of which  pqv  is similar  and  equal  to the figure
ivhich  the body P  describes  round  the movable  body S.  Q.E.I)
  CASE  2. Suppose  now  that  the common  centre  of gravity,  together  with
the space  in which  the bodies  are moved  among  themselves,  proceeds  uni
formly  in  a right  line  ; and  (by Cor.  6, of the Laws  of Motion)  all the mo

therefore  the  bodies  will describe  mutually  about  each  other  the same  fig
ures  as before, which  will  be therefore  similar  and  equal  to the  figure pqv.
Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Hence  two  bodies  attracting  each  other  with  forces proportional
to their  distance,  describe  (by Prop. X)  both  round  their common  centre  ol
gravity, and  round  each  other  mutually  concentrical  ellipses  ; and,  vice

the square  of their  distance,  describe  (by Prop.  XI, XII,  XIII),  both  round

         PROPOSITION   LIX.   THEOREM   XXII.

The  periodic  time  of two  bodies  S and  P revolving  round  their common
   centre  of gravity  C,is  to  the periodic  time  of one  of the  bwlies  1? re
  volving  round  the other  S remaining  unmoved,  and  describing  a fig
   ure  similar  and  equal  to those which  the  bodies  describe  about  each
   other mutually r, in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the other  body  S to  the  sii/rn
   of the bodies  S  -f P.
   For, by the demonstration  of  the last  Proposition,  the  times  in which
any  similar  arcs PQ  and pq  are described  are  in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the
distances CP  and  SP,  or  sp, that  is, in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the  ody S
to the sum  of the bodies  S + P.  And  by composition  of  ratios, the  sums
of the times  in which  all the similar  arcs PQ  and  pq  are  described,  that  is,
the whole  times  in which  the whole  similar  figures  are described  are  in the
same  subduplicate  ratio.  Q.E.D.

         PROPOSITION   LX.   THEOREM   XXIII.

If two  bodies  S and  P, attracting  each  other  with  forces  reciprocally  pro
  portional  to the squares  of their  distance,  revolve  about  their common
   centre  of gravity  ; I say,  that  the principal  axis  of the  ellipsis which
   either  of  the  bodies, as  P, describes  by this  motion  about  the other  S,
   will  be  to the principal  axis  of the  ellipsis, which  the same  body  P may
   describe  in  the same  periodical  time  about  the  other body  S quiescent,
   as  the sum  of the two  bodies  S +  P  to  the first of two  mean,  propor
   tionals  between  that sum  and  the other body  S.
   For  if the  ellipses described  were  equal  to each  other,  their  periodic  times
by the  last Theorem  would  be in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the body  S  to the
sum  of the bodies  S  4- P.  Let  the periodic  time  in  the  latter  ellipsis  be
diminished  in that  ratio, and  the  periodic  times  will become  equal ; but,
by Prop. XV,  the principal  axis  of the  ellipsis will  be diminished  in  a ratio
sesquiplicate  to the former  ratio ; that  is, in  a ratio  to which  the  ratio  of
S  to S  4- P  is triplicate  ; and  therefore  that  axis  will  be  to  the principal
axis  of the other  ellipsis  as the  first of two  mean  proportionals  between  S

 -f- P  and  S  to S  4- P.  And  inversely  the principal  axis  of the  ellipsis de
scribed  about  the movable  body  will be  to the principal  axis  of that  described
round  the immovable  as S + P  to the  first of two mean  proportionals  be
tween  S  4- P  and S.  Q.E.D.

         PROPOSITION   LXI.  THEOREM   XXIV.

 If two  bodies  attracting  each  other  with  any kind  of forces, and  not
   otherwise  agitated  or obstructed,  are moved  in any manner  whatsoever,
   those  'motions  will  be the same  as  if they did  not  at  all  attract  each
   other mutually,  but  were  both  attracted  with  the same  forces  by a third

   For  those  forces  with  which  the bodies  attract  each  other  mutually,  by

 of course,  the  ratio  of any  power  of one  distance  to the same  power  of  the

IK  will  be hindered  by causing  the system  of the bodies T  and  L  on  one
side, and  the body  S on  the  other, with  proper  velocities,  to revolve  round
the common  centre  of gravity C.  With  such  a motion  the body  S, because
the sum  of the motive  forces SD  X  T  and SD  X  L  is proportional  to the
distance  OS,  tends  to  the centre  C, will  describe  an  ellipsis round  the same
centre C;  and  the point D, because  the  lines CS  and CD   are proportional,
will describe  a like  ellipsis over  against  it.  But  the  bodies T  and  L, at
tracted  by the motive  forces SD  X T  and SD  X  L, the  first by the  first,
and  the  last by the  last, equally  and  in the direction  of the parallel  lines TI
and LK,  as was  said  before,  will  (by Cor.  5 and  6, of the Laws  of Motion)
continue  to describe  their  ellipses round  the  movable  centre  D, as  before.
Q.E.I.
   Let  there  be added  a fourth  body  V, and, by the  like  reasoning,  it will
be demonstrated  that  this body and  the point C  will  describe  ellipses about
the common   centre  of gravity B ; the motions  of  the  bodies  T, L, and  S
round  the centres  D  and  C remaining  the same  as before ; but  accelerated.
Arid by the same  method  one may  add  yet more  bodies  at pleasure.  Q..E.I.
 ^This  would  be the  case, though  the bodies T  and  L  attract  each  other
mutually  with  accelerative  forces  either  greater  or  less than  those  with
which  they  attract  the other  bodies  in proportion  to  their distance.  Let
all the mutual  accelerative  attractions  be  to each  other  as  the  distances

multiplied  into  the attracting  bodies  ; and from  what  has  gone  before  it
will  easily  be concluded  that  all the bodies  will  describe  different  ellipses
with  equal  periodical  times  about  their common   centre  of gravity  B, in an
immovable  plane.  Q.E.I.

         PROPOSITION   LXV.   THEOREM  XXV.

Bodies,  whose  forces  decrease  in a duplicate  ratio  of their distances from
   their  centres,  'may  move  among"  themselves  in  ellipses  ; and  by radii
  drawn   to the foci may  describe  areas  proportional  to the times  very
   nearly.

   In  the  last Proposition  we demonstrated  that  case  in which  the motions
will  be performed  exactly  in ellipses. The  more  distant  the law  of  the
forces  is from  the law  in that  case, the more  will  the  bodies  disturb  each

other's motions  ; neither  is it possible  that  bodies  attracting  each  other
mutually  according  to the law  supposed  in  this Proposition  should  move
exactly  in  ellipses, unless  by keepirg  a certain  proportion  of distances  from
each other.  However,  in the following  crises the  orbits  will not much  dif

one  at different  distances  from  it, and  suppose  absolute  forces  tending  to

that  the groat body may  be never  at  a sensible  distance  from  that  centre  ;
and  then  the great body  will, without  any  sensible  error, be either  at  rest,
or move  uniformly  forward  in  a  right  line; and  the  lesser  will  revolve
about  that  great  one  in  ellipses, and  by radii drawn  thereto  will  describe
areas  proportional  to the  times ; if we  except  the  errors  that may  be intro
duced  by the receding  of the great body from  the common   centre  of gravity,
or by the mutual  actions  of the  lesser bodies  upon  each  other.  But  the
lesser  bodies may  be so far diminished,  as that  this  recess  and  the mutual
actions  of the bodies  on  each  other may  become  less than  any  assignable;
and  therefore  so  as  that  the  orbits may  become  ellipses, and  the  areas  an
swer  to the  times, without  any  error  that  is not  less than  any  assignable.
Q.E.O.
  CASE  2. Let  us imagine  a system  of lesser bodies  revolving  about  a very
great  one  in the manner  just described,  or any  other system  of two  bodies
revolving  about  each  other  to be moving  uniformly  forward  in a right  line, and
in the mean  time  to be impelled  sideways  by the force  of another  vastly greater
body  situate  at  a great distance.  And  because  the equal accelerative  forces
with  which  the bodies  are impelled  in parallel  directions  do  not change  the
situation  of the bodies  with  respect  to each  other, but  only oblige  the whole
system  to change  its place while  the  parts  still retain  their motions  among
themselves,  it is manifest  that  no change  in those  motions  of  the  attracted
bodies  can  arise from  their  attractions  towards  the  greater,  unless  by the
inequality  of the accelerative  attractions,  or by the inclinations  of the  lines
towards  each  other,  in whose  directions  the attractions  are made.  Suppose,
therefore,  all the  accelerative  attractions  made  towards  the  great body
to be among  themselves  as the  squares  of the  distances  reciprocally  ; and
then, by increasing  the distance  of the great body  till the  differences  of fhe
right  lines drawn  from  that  to the  others  in respect  of their  length,  and  the
inclinations  of  those  lines  to each  other, be  less than  any  given,  the mo
tions  of  the  parts  of the system  will continue  without  errors  that  are  not
less than  any given.  And  because,  by the small  distance  of those  parts from
each  other,  the whole  system  is attracted  as if it were  but one  body,  it will
therefore  be moved  by  this attraction  as  if it were  one  body  ; that  is, its
centre  of gravity  will  describe  about  the great bod/  one  of  the  conic  sec
tions  (that  is, a parabola  or hyperbola  when  the attraction  is but languid
and  an  ellipsis when  it is more  vigorous)  ; and  by radii drawn  thereto,  it
will  describe  areas  proportional  to the  times, without  any  errors but  thos«
which  arise from  the distances  of the  parts, which  are by the  supposition
exceedingly  small, and may  be diminished  at pleasure.  Q,.E.O.

bation  be of the motions  of the  parts  of the system  among  themselves;  be
cause  the inclinations  of  the lines drawn  from  that  great  body  to those
parts become  greater  ; and  the inequality  of the proportion  is also greater.
   COR.  2. But  the perturbation  will be greatest  of  all, if we  suppose  the
uccelerative  attractions  of the parts  of the system  towards  the greatest body
of  all are  not  to each  other  reciprocally  as  the  squares  of  the  distances
from  that  great body ; especially  if the  inequality  of  this proportion  be
greater  than  the inequality  of the  proportion  of the  distances  from  the
great body.  For  if the  accelerative  force, acting  in parallel  directions
and  equally,  causes  no  perturbation  in the motions  of the  parts  of  the
system,  it must  of course, when  it acts unequally,  cause  a perturbation  some
where,  which  will  be greater  or  less  as  the  inequality  is greater  or  less.
The  excess  of the greater impulses  acting upon  some  bodies,  and  not  acting
upon  others, must  necessarily  change  their situation  among  themselves.  And
this  perturbation,  added  to the  perturbation  arising from  the inequality
and  inclination  of the  lines, makes  the whole  perturbation  greater.

   COR.  '*. Hence  if the parts  of  this system  move  in  ellipses  or  circles
without  any  remarkable  perturbation,  it is manifest  that,  if they  are  at  all
impelled  by accelerative  forces tending  to any  other  bodies,  the  impulse  is
very  weak,  or  else  is impressed  very  near  equally  and  in parallel  directions
upon  all of them.

   than   it would  if that  great  body  were  very much  more  or  very much

bodies T  and P.  By  this  force  alone  the body  P would  describe  round  the
body T,  by  the  radius PT,  areas  proportional  to the  times,  and  an
ellipsis whose  focus  is in the  centre  of the body  T  ; and  this  it would  do
whether  the body T  remained  unmoved,  or whether  it were  agitated  by that
attraction.  This  appears  from  Prop.  XI, and  Cor. 2  and  3  of  Theor.
XXI.  The  other  force  is that  of the  attraction  LM,  which,  because  it
tends  from  P  to T, will  be superadded  to and  coincide  with  the  former
force ; and  cause  the  areas  to be  still proportional  to the times, by Cor.  3,
Theor. XXI.   But  because  it is not  reciprocally  proportional  to the square
of the distance  PT,  it will  compose,  when  added  to  the  former,  a  force
varying  from  that  proportion  : which  variation  will  be the greater  by how
much  the proportion  of this force  to the former  is greater,  cceteris paribus.
Therefore,  since by Prop. XI,  and by Cor.  2, Theor.  XXI,  the  force  with
which  the  ellipsis  is described  about  the  focus T  ought  to be  directed  to
that  focus, and  to be reciprocally  proportional  to the square  of the distance
PT,  that compounded  force varying  from  that  proportion  will make  the
orbit PAB  vary from  the  figure  of an  ellipsis that  has  its focus  in the point

'I1 ; and  so much  the more  by how  much  the variation  from  that proportion
is greater  ; and  by consequence  by how  much  the proportion  of  the second
force LM   to the  first force  is greater,  cceteris paribus.  But  now  the  third
force SM,  attracting  the body  P  in a direction  parallel  to ST, composes  with
the other  forces  a new  force which  is no longer  directed  from  P to T  : and which
varies  so much  more  from  this direction  by how  much  the proportion  of this
third  force  to the other  forces  is greater,  cceteris paribus  ; arid therefore  causes
the body  P  to describe, by the radius TP,  areas  no longer proportional  to the
times  : and  therefore  makes  the variation  from  that proportionality  so much
greater by how  much  the proportion  of this force  to the  others  is greater.
But  this  third  force  will increase  the variation  of  the  orbit PAB  from  th*

| ed (by Cor. | 2. of the Laws | of Motion) | into the attrac | tion | s SM, | LM. And |
| so the body | P will be ur | ged with a | threefold accel | erati | ve forc | e. One of |
| these forces | tends towards | T, and arise | s from the mu | tual | attract | ion of the |
| bodies T an | d P. By this | force alone | the body P wo | uld | describe | round the |
| body T, b | y the radius | PT, areas | proportional t | o t | he time | s, and an |
| ellipsis whos | e focus is in | the centre of | the body T ; | and | this it | would do |
| whether the | body T remai | ned unmoved, | or whether i | t wer | e agitat | ed by that |
| attraction. | This appears | from Prop. | XI, and Cor | . 2 | and 3 | of Theor. |
| XXI. The | other force | is that of t | he attraction | LM, | which, | because it |
| tends from | P to T, will | be superadde | d to and coin | cide | with t | he former |
| force ; and | cause the areas | to be still | proportional t | o the | times, | by Cor. 3 |
| Theor. XXI | . But becaus | e it is not r | eciprocally pro | porti | onal to | the square |
| of the dist | ance PT, it wi | ll compose, | when added | to t | he forme | r, a force |
| varying fro | m that proport | ion : which | variation will | be t | he great | er by how |
| much the p | roportion of th | is force to t | he former is gr | eater | , cceteri | s paribus. |
| Therefore, | since by Prop. | XI, and by | Cor. 2, Theor. | XXI | , the | force with |
| which the e | llipsis is descri | bed about t | he focus T ou | ght | to be | directed to |
| that focus, | and to be recip | rocally propo | rtional to the | squa | re of t | he distance |

elliptical figure before-mentioned  upon  two  accounts  ; first because  that
force  is not  directed  from  P  to T  ; and, secondly,  because  it is not  recipro
cally proportional  to the square  of  the distance PT.  These  things  being
premised,  it is manifest  that  the  areas  are then  most  nearly  proportional  to
the  times, when  that  third  force  is the  least  possible, the  rest  preserving
their former  quantity  ; and  that  the  orbit PAB   does  then approach  nearest
to the  elliptical  figure above-mentioned,  when  both  the  second  and  third,
but  especially  the  third  force,  is the  least possible;  the  first  force remain
ing in  its former  quantity.
   Let  the  accelerative  attraction  of the body T  towards  S be expressed  by
the  line SN  ; then  if the accelerative  attractions SM  and SN  were  equal,
these, attracting  the  bodies T  and  P  equally and  in  parallel  directions
would  not  at  all change  their  situation  with  respect  to each other.  The  mo
tions  of the  bodies  between  themselves  would  be the same  in that  case  as if
those  attractions  did  not  act  at  all, by Cor.  6, of the Laws  of Motion.  And,
by a like reasoning,  if the  attraction SN  is less than  the attraction  SM,  it
will take away  out  of the attraction SM  the part SN,  so that  there  will  re
main  only  the part  (of the  attraction) MN   to disturb  the proportionality  of
the  areas  and  times, and  the  elliptical  figure  of the  orbit.  And  in  like
manner   if the attraction SN  be greater  than  the attraction  SM,  the pertur
bation  of the orbit  and  proportion  will  be produced  by the  difference MN
alone.  After  this manner  the attraction SN  reduces  always  the attraction
SM  to the attraction MN,  the  first and  second  attractions  rema  ning  per
fectly unchanged  ; and  therefore  the  areas  and  times come  then  nearest  to
proportionality,  and  the  orbit PAB   to the above-mentioned  elliptical  figure,
when  the  attraction MN   is either  none,  or  the  least  that  is possible;  that
is, when  the accelerative  attractions  of the bodies  P and T approach  as near
as possible  to equality ; that  is, when  the attraction SN  is neither  none  at
all, nor  less than  the  least of  all  the attractions  SM,  but  is, as  it were,  a
mean  between  the greatest  and  least  of  all those  attractions  SM,  that  is,
not much  greater  nor much  less than  the attraction SK.  Q.E.D.
   CASE  2. Let now  the  lesser  bodies  P. S, revolve  about  a greater T  in dif
ferent  planes ; and  the  force LM,  acting  in  the  direction  of  the  line PT
situate  in the plane  of the  orbit PAB,  will have  the same  effect  as before  ;
neither  will  it draw  the body  P from  the plane  of its orbit.  But  the other
force NM  acting  in the direction  of a line parallel  to ST  (and which,  there
fore, when  the body  S  is without  the  line  of the  nodes  is inclined  to the
plane  of the  orbit PAB),  besides  the perturbation  of the motion  just now
spoken  of as to longitude,  introduces  another  perturbation  also  as to latitude,
attracting  the body P  out  of the plane  of its orbit.  And  this perturbation,
in any  given  situation  of the bodies  P  and T  to each  other, will  be  as the
generating  force MN  ; and  therefore  becomes  least when  the  force MN   is
least,  that  is (as was  just now  shewn),  where  the attraction  SN  is not  nrirb
 greater  nor much  less than  the attraction SK.  Q.E.D.

  COR.  1. Hence  it may  be easily  collected,  that  if several  less  bodies P
8, R, &c.; revolve  about  a very  great body  T, the motion  of the innermost
revolving  body  P  will  be least disturbed  by the  attractions  of the  others.
when  the great body  is as  well  attracted  and  agitated  by the  rest (accord
ing  to the  ratio  of the  accelerative  forces) as  the  rest  are by each  other
mutually.
   COR.  2. In  a system  of three  bodies, T, P, S, if the  accelerative  attrac
tions  of any  two  of them  towards  a third  be  to each  other  reciprocally  as the
squares  of the distances,  the body  P, by the radius PT,  will describe  its area
about  the body T  swifter  near  the conjunction  A and  the opposition  B  than  it
will near  the quadratures  C  arid D.  For  every  force with  which  the body P
is acted  on and  the body T  is not, and which  does  not  act in the direction  of
the  line PT,  does  either  accelerate  or  retard  the  description  of the  area,
according  as  it is  directed, whether  in consequentia  or in  cwtecedentia.
Such  is the force NM.   This  force  in the  passage  of the  body  P frcm C
to A  is directed  in consequentia  to  its motion,  and  therefore  accelerates
it; then  as far  as D  in atttecedentia,  and  retards  the motion;  then  in, con
sequentia  as far as B  ; and  lastly in antecedentia  as  it moves  from  B  to C.
   COR.  3. And  from  the same  reasoning  it appears  that  the body  P ccBteris
paribuSj  moves  more  swiftly  in the conjunction  and  opposition  than  in the
quadratures.
   COR.  4. The  orbit  of the body  P, cc&teris paribus,  is more  curve  at the
quadratures  than  at  the  conjunction  and  opposition.  For  the  swifter
bodies  move,  the  less they  deflect from  a rectilinear path.  And  besides  the
force KL,  or NM,  at  the  conjunction  and  opposition,  is contrary  to  the
force with  which  the body T  attracts  the body  P, and  therefore  diminishes
that  force ; but  the body  P  will  deflect  the  less from  a rectilinear  path  the
less  it is impelled  towards  the body  T.
   COR.  5. Hence  the body  P, cceteris paribus,  goes farther from  the body
T  at the quadratures  than  at the conjunction  and  opposition.    This  is said,

however,  supposing  no  regard  had  to  the motion  of eccentricity.  For  if
the  orbit  of the body P  be  eccentrical,  its eccentricity  (as will  be shewn
presently  by Cor.  9) will  be  greatest  when  the  apsides  are in  the  syzy-
gies; and  thence  it may  sometimes  come  to  pass  that  the  body  P. in  its
near  approach  to  the farther  apsis, may  go farther  from  the body T  at the
syzygies  than  at the quadratures.

206           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES     [BOOK.   1

the body P  is retained  in its orbit,  is increased  at  the  quadratures  by tho
addition  caused  by the  force LM,  and  diminished  at  the  syzygies  by the
subduction  caused  by  the force KL,  and, because  the  force KL   is greater
than LM,  it is more  diminished  than  increased  ; and, moreover,  since  that
centripetal  force  (by Cor.  2, Prop.  IV)  is in  a ratio compounded  of the sim
ple ratio  of the radius TP  directly, and  the duplicate  ratio  of  the  periodi
cal time  inversely ; it is plain that  this compounded  ratio  is diminished  by
the action  of the force KL  ; and  therefore  that  the periodical  time, supposing
the radius  of  the  orbit PT  to remain  the same,  will  be increased,  and  that
in the subduplicate  of that  ratio  in which  the centripetal  force  is diminish
ed ; and,  therefore,  supposing  this radius  increased  or diminished,  the peri
odical  time  will  be increased  more  or diminished  less than  in the  sesquipli-
cate  ratio  of this radius, by Cor.  6, Prop. IV.   If that  force  of  the  central
body  should  gradually  decay,  the body  P being  less and  less attracted  would
go farther  and  farther  from  the centre T ; and,  on  the contrary,  if it were
increased,  it would  draw  nearer  to it.  Therefore  if the action  of the distant
body  S, by which  that  force  is diminished,  were  to  increase  and  decrease
by turns,  the radius TP  will  be  also increased  and  diminshed  by turns  ;
and  the periodical  time  will be increased  and  diminished  in  a  ratio  com
pounded  of the sesquiplicate  ratio  of the radius,  and  of the subduplicate  oi
that  ratio  in which  the centripetal  force  of  the central  body T  is dimin
ished  or increased, by  the increase  or decrease  of the action  of  the  distant
body  S.
   COR.  7.  It also  follows, from  what  was  before  laid down,  that  the  axis
of the  ellipsis described  by the body  P, or the line  of the  apsides,  does  as
to its angular  motion  go forwards  and backwards  by turns, but  more  for
wards  than  backwards,  and by the  excess  of  its direct motion  is in  the
whole  carried forwards.  For  the  force  with  which  the body  P  is urged  to
the body T  at the quadratures,  where  the  force MN  vanishes,  is compound
ed  of the force LM  and  the centripetal  force  with  which  the  body T  at
 tracts  the body P.  The  first force LM,  if the distance PT  be increased,  is
increased  in nearly  the same  proportion  with  that  distance, and  the  other
force  decreases  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  distance  ; and  therefore  the
sum  of these  two  forces  decreases  in a less than  the duplicate  ratio  of  the
distance PT  ; and  therefore, by Cor.  1, Prop. XLV,  will make  the  line  of
the  apsides,  or, which  is the same  thing,  the upper  apsis, to go backward.
But  at  the conjunction  and  opposition  the  force  with which  the body  P  is
urged  towards  the body T  is the difference  of the  force KL,  and  of  the
force  with  which  the body T  attracts  the body  P  ; and  that  difference,  be

| ed of the force | LM and the cen | tripetal force wi | th which t | he b | ody T at |

that  it either  goes forwards  or backwards  in proportion  to  the  excess  ol
one  of these  causes  above  the other.  Therefore  since  the  force KL   in the

syzygies  is almost  twice  as great  as  the force LM   in  the  quadratures,  the

two  bodies T  and  P  to be surrounded  on  every  side  by several  bodies  S,
S, S, dec., disposed  about  the  orbit ESE.   For  by the actions  of these  bo

the body  from  the lower  apsis  to the upper  ; and upon  a  like  increase  in

the proportion  of the  force  at the upper  apsis  to the  force  at the lower  ap
sis recedes  farthest  from  the duplicate  ratio of  the  distances  inversely ; it
is plain,  that, when  the apsides  are  in the  syzygies,  they  will, by reason  of
the subducting  force KL  or NM  —  LM,  go forward  more  swiftly  ; and  in
the quadratures  by the additional  force LM  go backward  more  slowly.

apsis, that  force by  a perpetual  accession  of new  force  is increased  in more
than  a duplicate  ratio  of the diminished  distance ; it is manifest  that  the
body, being impelled  always  towards  the centre by  the perpetual  accession
of this new  force, will  incline more  towards  that  centre  than  if it  were
urged by that  force  alone  which  decreases  in a duplicate  ratio  of the  di

elliptical  orbit, and  at the  lower  apsis approaching  nearer  to  the  centre

become  more  eccentrical.  If now,  while  the  body  is returning  from  the

fore  if the  force decreases  in  a yet greater  ratio, the  body, being now   less
attracted  than  before,  will ascend  to  a  still greater  distance,  and  so the  ec
centricity  of the  orbit  will  be increased  still more.  Therefore  if the  ratio
of the increase  and  decrease  of  the  centripetal  force  be augmented  each
revolution,  the  eccentricity  will  be augmented  also ; and, on the  contrary,
if that  ratio  decrease,  it will  be diminished.
  Now,  therefore,  in the system  of the bodies  T, P, S, when  the apsides  of
the  orbit FAB   are  in the quadratures,  the ratio  of that  increase  and  de
crease  is least of  all, and  becomes  greatest when  the  apsides  are  in  the
syzygies.  If the apsides  are  placed  in  the quadratures,  the  ratio  near  the
apsides  is less, and  near  the syzygies  greater,  than  the duplicate  ratio  of the
distances 7: and  from  that  oGreater  ratio  arises  a direct motion  of the  line of
the apsides,  as was  just now  said.  But  if we  consider  the  ratio  of  the
whole  increase  or decrease  in the progress  between  the  apsides,  this  is  less
than  the duplicate  ratio  of the distances.  The  force  in the lower  is to the
force  in the upper  apsis  in less than  a duplicate  ratio  of the distance  of the
upper  apsis from  the  focus  of the  ellipsis  to the distance  of the lower  apsis
from  the same  focus  ; and, contrariwise,  when  the apsides  are  placed  in the
syzygies,  the  force  in the lower  apsis  is to the  force  in the upper  apsis  in  a
greater  than  a duplicate  ratio  of the distances.  For  the forces LM   in the
quadratures  added  to  the forces  of the body T  compose  forces  in a less  ra
tio ; and  the  forces KL  in  the syzygies  subducted  from  the  forces  of  the
body  T, leave  the  forces  in  a  greater  ratio.  Therefore  the  ratio  of  the
whole  increase  and  decrease  in the passage  between  the apsides  is least  at
the quadratures  and  greatest  at the syzygies  ; and  therefore  in the passage
of the apsides from  the quadratures  to the syzygies  it is continually  aug
mented,  and  increases  the  eccentricity  of the  ellipsis ; and  in  the  passage
from  the syzygies  to the quadratures  it is perpetually  decreasing,  and  di
minishes  the  eccentricity.
   COR.  10. That  we may  give  an  account  of the  errors  as  to  latitude,  let
us suppose  the plane  of  the  orbit EST   to remain  immovable;  and  from
the cause  of  the errors  above  explained,  it is manifest,  that, of the  two
forces NM,  ML,  which  are the  only and  entire  cause  of them,  the  force
ML  acting always  in the plane  of the  orbit PAB  never  disturbs  the mo
tions  as  to latitude  ; and  that  the  force NM,  when  the  nodes  are  in  the
gyzygies,  acting  also  in the same  plane  of the  orbit, does  not  at that  time
affect  those motions.  But  when  the nodes  are in  the  quadratures,  it dis
turbs  tliem  very  much,  and, attracting  the  body P  perpetually  out  of  the
plane  of its orbit,  it diminishes  the inclination  of the plane  in the passage
 of the body from  the quadratures  to the syzygies, and  again  increases  the
same  in  the  passage  from  the  syzygies  to the quadratures.  Hence   it
comes  to pass  that when  the  body  is in the  syzygies,  the  inclination  is
 then  least  of all, and  returns  to the  first magnitude  nearly, when  the body

| fore if the f | orce decrea | ses in a yet | greater | ratio, the body, being | now less |
| attracted tha | n before, | will ascend | to a stil | l greater distance, and s | o the ec |
| centricity of | the orbit | will be inc | reased st | ill more. Therefore if | the ratio |
| of the increa | se and de | crease of t | he centr | ipetal force be augment | ed each |
| revolution, t | he eccentr | icity will | be augmen | ted also ; and, on the | contrary, |
| if that ratio | decrease, | it will be d | iminished | . |  |
| Now, ther | efore, in | the system | of the bo | dies T, P, S, when the a | psides of |
| the orbit FA | B are in | the quadrat | ures, the | ratio of that increase | and de |
| crease is leas | t of all, | and become | s greate | st when the apsides ar | e in the |

| apsides is les | s, and nea | r the syzyg | ies great | er, than the duplicate rat | io of the |
| distances : a | nd from
7 | that Greater
o | ratio ari | ses a direct motion of t | he line of |
| the apsides, | as was jus | t now said | . But | if we consider the rati | o of the |
| whole increa | se or decr | ease in the | progress | between the apsides, thi | s is less |
| than the dup | licate rat | io of the d | istances. | The force in the lower | is to the |
| force in the | upper aps | is in less th | an a dup | licate ratio of the distan | ce of the |
| upper apsis | from the | focus of the | ellipsis | to the distance of the lo | wer apsis |
| from the sam | e focus ; | and, contra | riwise, w | hen the apsides are plac | ed in the |
| syzygies, the | force in | the lower a | psis is to | the force in the upper a | psis in a |
| greater than | a duplica | te ratio of | the dist | ances. For the forces L | M in the |
| quadratures | added to | the forces o | f the bod | y T compose forces in | a less ra |
| tio ; and the | forces K | L in the sy | zygies s | ubducted from the force | s of the |
| body T, leav | e the forc | es in a gre | ater rat | io. Therefore the rati | o of the |
| whole increa | se and de | crease in th | e passage | between the apsides is | least at |
| the quadratu | res and g | reatest at t | he syzygi | es ; and therefore in the | passage |
| of the apside | s from t | he quadratur | es to th | e syzygies it is continua | lly aug |
| mented, and | increases | the eccentri | city of | the ellipsis ; and in the | passage |
| from the sy | zygies to | the quadrat | ures it i | s perpetually decreasing, | and di |
| minishes the | eccentric | ity. |  |  |  |
| COR. 10. | That we | may give a | n account | of the errors as to lat | itude, let |
| us suppose t | he plane | of the orbit | EST t | o remain immovable; a | nd from |
| the cause of | the error | s above ex | plained, | it is manifest, that, of | the two |

| ML acting | always in | the plane o | f the orb | it PAB never disturbs | the mo |

| affect those | motions. | But when | the node | s are in the quadratures | , it dis |

wnat  was  just now  shewn,  that  in  the  passage  of the  body  P from  either
node  to the ninetieth  degree from  thence,  the  inclination  of the  plane  is
perpetually  diminished  ; then,  in the passage  through  the  next  45  degrees
to the  next  quadrature,  the inclination  is increased  ; and  afterwards,  again,
in  its passage  through  another  45  degrees  to  the  next  node,  it  is dimin
ished.  Therefore  the inclination  is more  diminished  than  increased,  and
is therefore  always  less in the subsequent  node  than  in  the preceding  one.
And,  by a like reasoning,  the inclination  is more  increased  than  diminish
ed when  the nodes  are  in the  other  octants  between  A  and  D, B  and  C.
The  inclination,  therefore,  is the greatest  of all when  the  nodes  are  in the
syzygies  In  their passage  from  the syzygies  to the quadratures  the  incli
nation  is diminished  at each appulse  of the  body  to  the  nodes  : and  be
comes  least  of all when  the nodes  are  in the  quadratures,  and  the  body  in
the syzygies  ; then  it increases  by the same  degrees  by which  it decreased
before  ; and, when  the  nodes  come  to the  next  syzygies,  returns  to  its
former  magnitude.
   COR.  11. Because  when  the nodes  are  in the quadratures  the  body  P  is
perpetually  attracted  from  the plane  of its orbit  ; and  because  this  attrac
tion  is made  towards  S  in  its passage from  the  node  C  through  the  con
junction A  to the node  D  ; and  to the contrary  part  in  its passage  from  the
node D  through  the opposition  B  to the node C;  it is manifest  that,  in its
motion  from  the node  C, the  body  recedes  continually  from  the  former
plane CD   of its orbit  till it comes  to the next  node;  and  therefore  at that
node, being now  at  its greatest  distance  from  the  first plane CD,  it  will
pass through  the plane  of the  orbit EST   not  in D,  the  other  node  of  that
plane, but  in  a point  that  lies nearer  to  the  body  S, which  therefore  be
comes  a new  place  of the node  in, antecedent ia  to its former  place.  And,
by a like  reasoning,  the  nodes  will  continue  to  recede  in  their  passage
from  this node  to  the next.  The  nodes,  therefore, when  situate  in  the
quadratures,  recede  perpetually  ; and  at  the  syzygies, where  no  perturba
tion  can  be produced  in the motion  as to latitude,  are  quiescent : in  the in
termediate  places they partake  of both  conditions,  and  recede  more  slowly  ;
and, therefore,  being always  either  retrograde  or  stationary,  they  will  be
carried  backwards,  or in atitecedentia,  each  revolution.

at the conjunction  of  the  bodies  P, S, than  at  their  opposition ; because
the generating  forces NM  and ML   are  greater.
   COR.  13. And  since  the causes  and  proportions  of the errors  and  varia
tions mentioned  in these  Corollaries  do not depend  upon  the magnitude  of
the body  S, it follows  that  all things  before  demonstrated  will  happen,  if
the magnitude  of the body  S be imagined   so great  as that  the system  of the
two  bodies P and T  may  revolve  about  it.  And  from  this increase  of  the
body  S, and  the consequent  increase  of its centripetal  force, from  which  the
errors  of the body P  arise,  it will follow  that  all these  errors,  at equal  dis
tances,  will  be greater  in this  case, than  in the other where  the body  S  re
volves  about  the system  of the bodies  P  and  T.
   COR.  14. But  since  the  forces NM,  ML,  when  the body  S  is exceedingly
distant,  are  very  nearly  as the  force SK  and  the  ratio PT   to ST   con-
junctly  ; that  is, if both  the distance  PT,  and  the absolute  force  of the body

8 be given,  as ST3  reciprocally  : and  since  those  forces NM, ML   are  the
causes  of all the  errors  and  effects  treated  of in the foregoing  Corollaries;
it is manifest  that  all those  effects, if the system  of  bodies T  and  P  con
tinue  as before, and  only  the distance  ST  and  the absolute  force  of the body
S  be changed,  will  be very  nearly  in  a ratio compounded  of the direct  ratio
of the absolute  force  of the body  S, and  the triplicate  inverse  ratio  of  the
distance ST.  Hence  if the system  of bodies T  and  P  revolve  about  a dis
tant body  S, those  forces NM,  ML,  and  their  eifl  ts, will  be (by Cor.  2 and
6, Prop  IV) reciprocally  in a duplicate  ratio  c/f the periodical time.  And
thence,  also,  if the magnitude  of the bodv  S be proportional  to  its absolute
force, those  forces NM,  ML,  and  their  effects, will be  directly  as  the  cube
of the apparent  diameter  of the distant  body  S viewed  from  T, and  so  vice
versa.  For  these  ratios  are  the same  as the compounded  ratio  above  men
tioned.

   COR.  15. And  because  if the  orbits ESE  and PAB,  retaining  their  fig
ure, proportions,  and  inclination  to each  other, should  alter  their magni
tude ; arid the  forces  of  the  bodies  S  and  T  should  either  remain,  or be
changed  in any  given  ratio ; these  forces  (that  is, the force  of  the body  T,
which  obliges  the body  P  to deflect from  a rectilinear  course  into  the  orbit
PAB,  and  the  force  of the body  S, which  causes  the body  P to deviate  from
 that  orbit) would  act always  in the same  manner,  and  in the same  propor
 tion  : it follows,  that  all the  effects  will  be similar  and  proportional,  arid
 the times  of those  effects proportional  also ; that  is, that  all the  linear  er
 rors  will  be  as tne diameters  of the  orbits, the angular  errors  the same   as
 before  ; and  the  times  of similar  linear  errors,  or  equal angular  errors?  as
 the periodical  times  of the  orbits.
   COR.  16. Therefore   if the  figures  of the  orbits and  their  inclination  to
 each  other  be given, and  the magnitudes,  forces,  arid distances  of the bodies
he any how  changed,  we  may.  from  the  errors  and  times  of those  errors  in

one  case,  collect  very  nearly  the  errors  and  times  of the  errors  in any  other
case.  But  this may  be done  more  expeditiously  by the following  method.
The  forces NM;  ML,  other  things remaining  unaltered,  are  as  the  radius
TP  ; and  their  periodical  effects (by Cor.  2, Lein. X)  are  as the  forces  and
the square  of the periodical  time  of the body  P conjunctly.  These  are  the
linear  errors  of the body  P  ; and  hence  the angular  errors  as  they appear
from  the centre T  (that  is, the motion  of the apsides  and  of the  nodes, and  all
the apparent  errors  as  to longitude  and  latitude)  are  in each  revolution  of
the body  P  as  the square  of the  time  of the  revolution,  very nearly.  Let
these  ratios  be compounded  with  the  ratios  in Cor.  14, and  in  any  system
of bodies  T, P, S, where  P  revolves  about  T  very  near  to  it, and  T  re
volves  about  S  at  a great  distance,  the angular  errors  of the  body  P, ob
served  from  the centre  T,  will  be in each  revolution  of the body  P  as  the
square  of the periodical  time  of the body  P  directly, and  the square  of  the
periodical  time  of the body T  inversely.  And  therefore  the mean  motion
of the  line  of the apsides  will  be  in  a given  ratio  to  the mean  motion  of
the nodes  ; and  both  those motions  will  be  as  the  periodical  time  of  the
body P  directly, and  the square  of the periodical  time  of  the body T  in
versely.  The  increase  or diminution  of the  eccentricity  and  inclination  of
the orbit PAB  makes  no  sensible  variation  in the motions  of  the  apsides*
and  nodes,  unless  that  inc/case  or diminution  be very  great  indeed.

by that  radius PT  ; and  then  that mean  force  will  be  to the mean  force
SK  or SN  (which may  be  also expressed  by ST)  as the length PT  to  the
length ST.  But  the mean  force SN  or ST,  by which  the body T  is re
tained  in the  orbit  it describes  about  S, is to the  force  with  which  the body P
is retained  in  its orbit about  T  in  a ratio compounded   of the ratio  of  the
radius ST  to the radius PT,  and  the duplicate  ratio  of the periodical  time
of the body P  about T  to the periodical  time  of the body T  about S.  And,
ex  cequo,  the mean  force LM   is to the  force by which  the body P  is retain
ed  in  its orbit  about T  (or by which  the same  body P might  revolve  at the
distance PT  in the same  periodical  time  about  any immovable  point T)  in
the same  duplicate  ratio  of  the  periodical  times.  The  periodical  times
therefore  being  given, together  with  the  distance PT,  the mean  force LM
is also given  ; and  that  force being  given,  there  is given  also the force MN,
very  nearly, by the analogy  of the  lines PT  and MN.

  Con.  IS. By  tlie same  laws  by which  the  body  P  revolves  about  the
body  T,  let us suppose  many  fluid  bodies  to move  round  T  at equal  dis
tances  from  it ; and  to be so numerous,  that they may  all become  contiguous
to each  other,  so  as  to form  a fluid  annul  us,  or  ring, of  a round  figure, and
concentrical  to the body T;  and  the several  parts  of this annulus,  perform
ing their motions  by  the same  law  as the body  P, will draw  nearer  to  the
body T, and  move  swifter  in the conjunction  and  opposition  of themselves
and  the body  S, than  in the quadratures.  And  the nodes  of  this annulus,
or  its intersections  with  the plane  of the  orbit  of the body S  or T, will  rest
at the syzygies  ; but  out  of the syzygies  they  will  be carried  backward,   or
in. antecedentia  ; with  the greatest  swiftness  in the quadratures,  and  more
slowly  in other places.  The  inclination  of this annulus  also will  vary, and
its axis  will  oscillate  each  revolution,  and  when  the revolution  is completed
will return  to its former  situation,  except  only that  it will be carried  round
a little by  the precession  of the  nodes.
   COR.  19. Suppose  now  the spherical  body  T, consisting  of some  matter
not  fluid, to be enlarged,  and  to extend  its 'If on  every  side  as  far  as  that
annulus,  and  that  a channel  were  cut  all round  its circumference  contain
ing water  j and  that  this sphere  revolves  uniformly  about  its own   axis  in
the same  periodical time.  This  water  being  accelerated  and  retarded  by
turns  (as in the  last Corollary),  will  be swifter  at the syzygies, and  slower
at the quadratures,  than  the surface  of the globe, and  so will  ebb  and  flow  in
its channel  after  the manner  of the sea.  If the attraction  of the body  S were
taken  away,  the water  would  acquire  no motion  of flux and  reflux  by revolv-
 .ng round  the quiescent  centre  of the globe.  The  case  is the same  of  a globe
moving  uniformly  forwards  in  a right  line, and  in the mean  time revolving
about  its centre  (by Cor.  5 of the Laws  of  Motion),  and  of  a  globe  uni
formly  attracted  from  its rectilinear  course  (by Cor.  6, of  the same  Laws).
But  let the body  S come  to act upon  it, and  by its unequable  attraction  the
A\ater  will  receive  this new  motion  ; for  there  will  be  a stronger  attraction
upon  that  part  of the water  that  is nearest  to the body, and  a weaker  upon
that  part which  is more  remote.  And  the  force LM   will  attract  the water
downwards   at the quadratures,  and  depress  it as far  as the syzygies  ; and  the
force KL   will  attract  it upwards  in the syzygies,  and  withhold  its descent,
and make  it rise  as  far  as  the  quadratures  ; except  only  in so far  as the
motion  of flux and  reflux may  be directed  by the channel  of the  water, and
be a little retarded  by  friction.
   COR.  20.  If, now,  the annulus  becomes  hard, and  the globe  is diminished,
 the motion  of flux and  reflux  will  cease  ; but  the oscillating  motion  of the
 inclination  and  the praecession  of the  nodes  will remain.  Let  the  globe
have  the same  axis with  the annulus,  and  perform  its revolutions  in  the
same  times, and  at  its surface  touch  the annulus  within,  and  adhere  to it;
 then  the globe partaking  of the motion  of the annulus,  this whole  compares

will  oscillate, and  the nodes  will go backward,  for  the  globe, as  \ve  shall
shew  presently,  is perfectly  indifferent  to the  receiving  of all impressions.
The  greatest  angle  of  the inclination  of  the annulus  single  is when  the
nodes  are  in the syzygies.  Thence  in  the  progress  of  the nodes  to  the
quadratures,  it endeavours  to diminish  its inclination,  and  by that  endea
vour  impresses  a motion  upon  the whole  globe.  The  globe  retains  this
motion  impressed,  till the  annulus  by  a contrary  endeavour  destroys  that
motion,  and  impresses  a new  motion  in  a contrary  direction.  And  by  this
means  the greatest  motion  of the decreasing  inclination  happens  when  the
nodes  are  in the quadratures;  and  the least angle  of inclination  in the octants





                B

after  the quadratures  ; and, again,  the greatest  motion  of roclination  happens
when  the nodes  are  in the syzygies  ; and  the greatest  angle  of reclination  in
the octants following.  And  the  case  is the same  of  a globe without  this  an
nulus,  if it be a little higher  or  a little denser  in the equatorial  than  in the
polar regions  : for the  excess  of that  matter  in the regions  near  the equator
supplies  the place  of the annulus.  And  though  we  should  suppose  the  cen
tripetal  force  of this globe  to be any how  increased,  so  that  all  its parts
were  to tend downwards,  as the  parts  of our  earth  gravitate  to  the  centre,
yet the phenomena   of this and  the preceding  Corollary  would  scarce  be  al
tered  ; except  that  the places  of the greatest  and  least height  of  the water
will  be different  : for the water  is now  no longer  sustained  and  kept  in  its
orbit by  its centrifugal  force, but by the channel  in which   it flows.  And,
besides,  the  force LM   attracts  the water  downwards  most  in  the quadra

tures, and  the  force KL   or NM  — LM   attracts  it upwards  most  in  the
syzygies.  And  these  forces  conjoined  cease  to attract  the water downwards,
and  begin  to attract  it upwards  in  the  octants  before  the  syzygies  ; and
cease  to attract  the water  upwards,  and  begin  to  attract  the  water  down
wards  in the octants  after  the syzygies.  And  thence  the greatest  height  of
the water  may  happen  about  the  octants  after  the syzygies  ; and  the  least
height  about  the octants  after  the quadratures  ; excepting  only  so far as the
motion  of ascent  or descent  impressed  by these  forces may  by the vis insita
of the water  continue  a little longer,  or be stopped  a little sooner  by impe
diments  in its channel.

   COR.  21.  For  the same  reason  that redundant  matter  in the  equatorial
regions  of  a globe  causes  the nodes  to go backwards,  and  therefore  by the
increase  of that matter  that retrogradation  is increased, by the diminution
is diminished,  and by the removal  quite  ceases  : it follows,  that,  if more  than

| shew presently, | is perfe | ctly indif | ferent | to the rece | iving of all | impressions. |
| The greatest | angle of | the incli | nation | of the annu | lus single | is when the |
| nodes are in t | he syzygi | es. Then | ce in | the progre | ss of the n | odes to the |
| quadratures, i | t endeavo | urs to di | minish | its inclinati | on, and by | that endea |

| motion impres | sed, till | the annu | lus by | a contrary | endeavour d | estroys that |
| motion, and i | mpresses | a new mot | ion in | a contrary | direction. | And by this |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| polar regions : | for the | excess of | that ma | tter in the | regions near | the equator |
| supplies the pl | ace of th | e annulus | . And | though we | should supp | ose the cen |

that redundant  matter  be taken  away,  that  is, if the globe  be  either  more
depressed,  or of  a  more  rare  consistence  near  the  equator  than  near  the
poles, there  will  arise  a motion  of the nodes  in consequentia.
   COR.  22. And  thence  from  the motion  of the nodes  is known  the  consti
tution  of the globe.  That  is, if the globe  retains  unalterably  the same  poles,
and  the motion  (of the nodes)  be  in. antecedetitia,  there  is a redundance  oi
the matter  near  the equator;  but  if in  conseqnentia,  a deficiency.  Sup
pose  a uniform  and  exactly spherical  globe  to be  first  at rest  in a free space   :
then by some  impulse  made  obliquely  upon  its superficies  to be driven  from
its place, and  to receive  a motion  partly  circular  and  partly  right forward.
Because  this globe  is perfectly  indifferent  to all the  axes  that  pass through
its centre,  nor  has  a greater  propensity  to one  axis  or  to  one  situation  oi
the  axis than  to any  other,  it is manifest  that  by its own  force  it will never
change  its axis, or the inclination  of it.  Let now  this globe  be  impelled
obliquely  by  a new  impulse  in the same  part  of  its superficies  as  before      .
and  since  the  effect  of an impulse  is not  at  all changed  by  its coming  sooner
or later,  it is manifest  that  these  two  impulses,  successively  impressed,  will
produce  the same  motion  as if they were  impressed  at  the same  time  : that
is, the same  motion  as if the globe had  been  impelled  by a simple  force
compounded  of them  both  (by Cor.  2, of the Laws),  that  is, a simple motion
about  an  axis  of a given inclination.  And  the  case  is the same  if the  sec
ond  impulse  were  made  upon  any  other  place  of  the  equator  of  the  first
motion  ; and  also  if the  first impulse  were  made  upon  any  place  in  the
equator  of the motion  which  would  be  generated  by the  second  impulse
alone; and  therefore,  also, when  both  impulses  are made  in  any  places
whatsoever  ; for these impulses  will generate  the same  circular  motion   as
if they were  impressed  together,  and  at once,  in the  place  of the  intersec
tions  of the equators  of those  motions,  which  would  be generated  by each
of them  separately.  Therefore,  a homogeneous  and  perfect globe  will  not
retain  several  distinct  motions,  but  will  unite  all those  that  are impressed
on  it, and  reduce  them  into one;  revolving,  as far  as in  it lies, always  with
a simple  and  uniform  motion  about  one  single given  axis, with  an  inclina
tion perpetually  invariable.  And  the inclination  of the  axis, or the velocity
 of the  rotation,  will  not  be changed  by centripetal  force.  For  if the globe
 be supposed  to be  divided  into  two  hemispheres,  by any  plane whatsoever
passing  through  its own  centre, and  the centre  to which  the force  is direct
 ed, that  force  will always  urge  each hemisphere  equally  ; and  therefore  will
not  incline  the globe any  way  as to its motion  round  its own  axis.  But
 let there  be added  any  where  between  the pole and  the  equator  a heap  oi
 new  matter  like  a mountain,  and  this, by  its perpetual  endeavour  to recede
 from  the  centre  of  its motion,  will  disturb  the  motion  of  the  globe, and
 cause  its poles  to wander  about  its  superficies, describing  circles  about
 themselves  and  their  opposite points.  Neither  can  this enormous  evagatior

directed  towards  O, the common  centre  of gravity   S(i

body  T  ; and  which  is more  in a reciprocal  propor

 ST  : as will  easily appear  by a little consideration.

       PROPOSITION   LXVIII.  THEOREM   XXVIII.

 The  same  laws  of attraction  supposed,  I say, that  the  exterior  body S
    will, by radii drawn   to O, the common   centre  of gravity  of the interior
   bodies  P   and    T,   describe   round   that    centre   areas  more  propor

   do  if that body  were  either  at  rest  as  not  attracted,  or were  much  tnore

Bommon  centre  of the  three, and  the  perturbation  will  be  increased  yet
                     more.  Therefore  the perturbation   is least when  the
                     common   centre  of  the  three  bodies  is at rest;  that
                                Iis, when  the innermost  and  greatest  body T  is at
                           tracted according  to the same  law  as the  rest  are ;
                          and  is always  greatest when  the common   centre  of
the  three, by the  diminution  of  the  motion  of  the body  T, begins  to be
moved,  and  is more  and  more  agitated.
   COR.  And  hence  if more  lesser bodies  revolve  about  the  great  one,  it
may  easily  be inferred  that  the  orbits  described  will approach  nearer  to
ellipses ; and  the descriptions  of  areas  will  be more  nearly  equable,  if  all
the  bodies mutually  attract  and  agitate  each  other  with  accelerative  forces
that  are  as  their  absolute  forces  directly, and  the  squares  of  the distances
inversely  : and  if the  focus  of each  orbit  be placed  in  the common   centre
of gravity  of  all the  interior  bodies  (that  is. if the  focus  of the  first and  in
nermost  orbit  be placed  in the  centre  of gravity  of the  greatest and  inner
most  body  : the  focus  of the second  orbit  in the common  centre  of gravity
of the two  innermost  bodies;  the  focus  of the third  orbit  in  the common

towards  A  is to the accelerative  attraction  of the body A  towards  B  as the
mass  of the body A  to the mass  of the body  B ; because  the  motive  forces
which  (by the  2d, 7th, and  8th  Definition)  are  as the  accelerative  forces
and  the bodies  attracted  conjunctly  are here  equal  to  one  another  by the

absolute  attractive  force  of the body  B  aa the mass  of the  body A  to the

   These  Propositions  naturally  lead  us to  the  analogy  there  is between
 centripetal  forces, and  the central  bodies  to which  those  forces  used  to be
 directed ; for  it is reasonable  to suppose  that  forces which  are  directed  to
 bodies  should  depend  upon  the nature  and  quantity  of those  bodies,  as we
 see they  do  in magnetical  experiments.  And  when  such  cases  occur, we
 are  to compute  the attractions  of the bodies  by assigning  to each  of  their
 particles  its proper  force, and  then  collecting  the sum  of them  all.  I here
 ue*e the word  attraction  in general  for any  endeavour,  of what  kind  soever,
 made  by bodies  to approach  to each  other;  whether  that endeavour  arise
 from  the action  of the bodies  themselves,  as tending  mutually  to  or agita
 ting each  other  by spirits emitted;  or whether  it arises from  the  action
 of the  aether  or of the  air, or  of any medium  whatsoever*  whether  corporeal
 or incorporeal,  any how  impelling  bodies  placed  therein  towards  each  other.
 In the same  general  sense  I use  the word  impulse,  not  defining  in this  trea

made,  we  argue  more  safely concerning  the  physical  species,  causes,  and
proportions  of  the forces.  Let  us  see, then, with  what  forces  spherical
bodies  consisting  of particles endued  with  attractive  powers  in the manner

If to every point  of a spherical  surface  there  tend equal  centripetal  forces
  decreasing  in, the duplicate  ratio  of the distances from  those  points  ;
   I say,  that  a corpuscle  placed  within  that  superficies  will  not  be attract

                        Cor.  3, Lem.  VII)  the triangles HPI,LPK   are  alike,
                         those  arcs  will be proportional  to  the  distances HP
                  LP  ; and  any  particles  at HI  and KL   of the spheri
cal superficies, terminated  by right  lines passing through  P, will  be in the
duplicate  ratio  of those distances.  Therefore  the  forces  of  these  particles
exerted  upon  the body  P  are  equal between  themselves.  For  the forces  are
as the  particles  directly, and  the squares  of  the distances  inversely.  And
these  two  ratios compose  the  ratio  of equality.  The  attractions  therefore,
being made  equally  towards  contrary  parts, destroy  each other.  And  by a
like reasoning  all the attractions  through  the  whole  spherical  superficies
are destroyed  by contrary  attractions.  Therefore  the  body  P  will not  be
any way  impelled  by those attractions.  Q.E.D.

cles situate  without  the gpheres  in those  diameters  produced.     Let   there





be drawn  from  the  corpuscles  the  lines PHK,  PIL,  phk,  pil, cutting  off

 I )F, df may  be taken  for equal ; because  their  last  ratio, when  the angles
DPE,  dpe vanish  together,  is the  ratio  of equality.  These  things  then
supposed,  it will  be, as PI  to PF  so  is RI  to DF,  and  as pf  to pi so  is df  or
DF   to  ri ; and,  ex  cequo,  as PI  X  pf  to PF  X  pi so  is R I to  ri, that  is

PS  X pi  as IQ.  to iq.  And  compounding  the  ratios PI2  X  pf  X ps  is to
pi2 X PF  X  PS,  as IH  X  IQ  to ih X  iq ; that  is, as the  circular  super

 themselves  directly, and  the squares  of the distances  of the superficies from
 those  corpuscles  inversely;  that  is, as pf  X ps  to PF  XPS.  And  these
 forces  again  are  to the oblique  parts  of them  which  (by the  resolution  of
 forces  as in Cor.  2, of the Laws)  tend  to the  centres  in the directions  of the
 lines PS,  JDS-, as PI  to PQ,  and pi  to pq ; that  is (because  of the  like trian
 gles PIQ  and PSF,  piq  and psf\  as PS  to PF  and ps  to pf.  Thence  ex

 the corpusclejo  towards  5  as     ~      =—  is to                —  , that  is,

 perficies described  by the revolution  of the  arcs KL,  kl  attract  those  cor

 of all the circular  superficies  into which  each  of  the  sphaerical  superficies
 may  be divided  by taking  sd always  equal  to SD,  and  se equal  to SE.  And

If to the several  points  of a sphere  there  tend  equal  centripetal  forces  de
   creasing  in a duplicate  ratio  of the distances from  those  points  ; and
   there  be given  both  the density  of the  sphere and  the  ratio  of the di
   ameter  of the sphere  to the distance  of the corpuscle from   its centre  ;
   I say,  that  the force  with  which  the corpuscle  is attracted  is propor
   tional  to the semi-diameter  of the sphere.
   For  conceive  two  corpuscles  to be severally  attracted  by two  spheres,  one
by one, the  other by the  other, and  their  distances  from  the  centres  of  the
spheres  to be proportional  to the diameters  of the spheres  respectively  , and
the spheres  to be resolved  into  like  particles, disposed  in a  like  situation
to the corpuscles.  Then  the attractions  of one  corpuscle  towards  the  sev
eral particles  of one  sphere  will be  to the attractions  of the  other  towards
as many  analogous  particles  of the other  sphere  in  a ratio compounded  of
the ratio  of the particles  directly,  and  the duplicate  ratio  of the  distances
inversely.  But  the  particles  are  as the spheres,  that  is, in a triplicate  ra
tio of the diameters,  and  the distances  are  as the diameters  ; and  the  first
ratio  directly with  the  last ratio  taken  twice  inversely, becomes  the  ratio
of diameter  to diameter.  Q.E.D.

of matter  equally  attracting, and  the  distances  from  the  centres  of  the

 LXXII)   this  is as the distance PS.  Q.E.D.

                      SCHOLIUM.

  By  the superficies  of which  I here imagine  the  solids composed,  I do  not
mean  superficies  purely  mathematical,  but  orbs  so  extremely  thin, that
their  thickness  is as nothing;  that  is, the evanescent  orbs  of which  the sphere
will  at last consist  when  the number  of the  orbs  is increased,  and  their
thickness  diminished  without  end.  In  like manner,  by the points  of which
lines, surfaces,  and  solids  are  said  to be composed,  are  to be  understood
equal  particles, whose  magnitude  is perfectly  inconsiderable.

       PROPOSITION   LXXIV.   THEOREM  XXXIV.

The  same  things  supposed,  I  say,  that  a corpuscle  situate  without  the
   sphere  is attracted  with  a force  reciprocally  proportional  to the square
   of its distance from  the  centre.
   For  suppose  the sphere  to be divided  into innumerable  concentric  sphe
rical  superficies, and  the attractions  of the corpuscle  arising from  the  sev
eral  superficies  will  be reciprocally  proportional  to the square  of the  dis
tance  of  the corpuscle  from  the  centre  of  the  sphere  (by Prop. LXXI).
And, by composition,  the sum  of  those  attractions,  that  is, the  attraction
of  the corpuscle  towards  the entire  sphere,  will  be in  the same  ratio.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Hence  the attractions  of homogeneous  spheres  at equal  distances
from  the centres  will  be as  the spheres themselves.  For  (by Prop. LXXII)
if the distances  be proportional  to the diameters  of  the  spheres,  the  forces
will be  as the diameters.  Let  the greater  distance  be diminished  in  that
ratio ; and  the distances  now  being  equal,  the  attraction  will  be  increased
in the duplicate  of that  ratio ; and  therefore  will  be  to the other  attraction
in the  triplicate  of that  ratio ; that  is, in the  ratio  of the  spheres.
   COR.  2. At  any  distances  whatever  the  attractions  are  as  the  spheres
applied  to the squares  of the  distances.
   COR.  3.  If a corpuscle  placed without  an homogeneous  sphere  is attract
ed by a force  reciprocally  proportional  to the square  of  its distance  from
the centre, and  the sphere  consists  of attractive  particles,  the  force  of ever y
particle  will decrease  in a duplicate  ratio  of the distance  from  each  particle.

is therefore  the same  as  if that  whole  attracting  force  issued  from  one  sin

great  as on  the  other hand  the attraction  of the same  corpuscle  would  be,
if that  were  itself attracted  by the several  particles  of the  attracted  sphere
with  the same  force  with  which  they  are  attracted  by it.  But  that  attrac

tional  to the square  of its distance  from  the centre  of the sphere  : therefore
the attraction  of the sphere, equal  thereto,  is also in the same  ratio.  Q,.E.D.
   COR.  1. The  attractions  of  spheres  towards  other homogeneous  spheres
are  as the attracting  spheres  applied  to the squares  of the distances  of their
centres  from  the  centres  of those  which  they  attract.
   COR.  2. The  case  is the same  when  the  attracted  sphere  does  also  at
tract.  For  the several  points  of the  one  attract  the several  points  of  the
other  with  the same  force  with  which  they themselves  are  attracted  by the
others again;  and  therefore  since  in  all attractions  (by Law  III) the  at
tracted  and  attracting  point  are both  equally  acted  on, the  force  will  be
doubled  by their mutual  attractions,  the proportions  remaining.
   COR.  3. Those  several  truths  demonstrated  above  concerning  the motion
of bodies  about  the  focus  of  the  conic  sections  will  take  place when  an
attracting  sphere  is placed  in the  focus, and  the  bodies  move  without  the
sphere.
   COR.  4. Those  things which  were  demonstrated  before  of  the motion  of
bodies  about  the centre  of the  conic  sections  take  place when  the motions
are performed  within  the sphere.

ff spheres  be however  dissimilar  (as to density  of matter  and  attractive,
  force]  in the same  ratio onward  from  the centre  to the circumference  ;
   but  every  where  similar,  at every  given  distance from  the centre,  on  all
   sides round  about  ; and  the attractive  force  of  every point  decreases
   in the duplicate  ratio  of the distance  of the body  attracted  ; I say,
   that  the whole  force  with  which  one  of these spheres  attracts  the  oilier
   will  be reciprocally  proportional  to the square  of the  distance  of  the
   centres.

  whole  sphere GH  (composed  of any  concentric  spheres  or their  differences)
  in the same  ratio.  Let  the number  of the concentric  spheres  be  increased
   in infinitum,  so that  the density  of the matter  together  with  the attractive
  force may,  in the progress  from  the circumference  to the  centre,  increase  or
  decrease  according  to any  given law  ; and  by the addition  of matter  not  at

  any form  desired  ; and  the  force  with  which  one  of these  attracts  the  other
  will  be  still, by the former  reasoning,  in the same  ratio  of the square  of the

     COR.  I. Hence  if many  spheres  of this kind, similar  in  all  respects,  at

  any  equal  distances  of the  centre's, will be  as the attracting  spheres.
     COR.  2. And  at any  unequal  distances,  as the  attracting  spheres  applied
   to the squares  of the distances  between  the  centres.

  one  another,  will  be  at equal  distances  of the centres  as the attracting  and
  attracted  spheres  conjunctly  ; that  is, as the products  arising from  multi
  plying  the spheres  into  each  other.
     COR.  4. And  at unequal  distances,  as  those  products  directly, and  the
  squares  of the distances  between  the centres  inversely.
     COR.  5. These  proportions  take  place  also when  the  attraction  arises
  from  the  attractive  virtue  of both  spheres  mutually  exerted  upon  each
  other.  For  the  attraction  is only doubled  by the conjunction  of the  forces,
   the proportions  remaining  as before.
     COR.  6.  If spheres  of this kind  revolve  about  others  at  rest, each  about

 Tf to 1 he several points  of spheres  there  tend  centripetal  forces  propor
   tional  to the distances  of the points from  the attracted  bodies ; I say,
   that  the compounded  force  with  which  two  spheres  attract  each  other
   mutually  is as  the distance  between  the centres  of the spheres.
                                CASE  1. Let AEBF   be  a sphere ; S  its
                                      centre  . P  a  corpuscle  attracted  : PA SB
                                      the  axis  of the sphere  passing through  the
                                       centre  of the corpuscle  ; EF,  ef two  planes
                                   cutting  the  sphere, and  perpendicular  to
                                      the  axis, and  equi-distant,  one  on  one  side,
                                      the other  on the  other, from  the  centre  of

                                      the sphere ; G  and  g- the  intersections  of
the planes  and  the  axis  ; and H  any  point  in the plane EF.  The  centri
petal  force  of the point H  upon  the corpuscle  P, exerted  in the direction  of
the  line PH,  is as the distance PH  ; and  (by Cor.  2, of the Laws)  the same
exerted  in the  direction  of the  line PG,  or towards  the  . centre  S, is as the
length PG.  Therefore  the  force  of all the points  in the plane EF  (that  is,
of that whole  plane) by which  the  corpuscle P  is attracted  towards  the
centre  S  is as the distance PG  multiplied  by the number  of those  points,
that  is, as the  solid contained  under  that  plane EF  and  the  distance  PG.
And  in like manner  the  force  of the plane  ef, by which  the  corpuscle  P  is
attracted  towards  the  centre  S, is as that plane drawn  into  its distance Pg,
or  as the equal plane EF  drawn  into  that distance  Pg* ; and  the sum  of the
forces  of both  planes  as the plane EF  drawn  into  the sum  of the distances
PG  +  P^,  that  is, as that plane drawn  into  twice  the distance PS  of  the
centre  and  the  corpuscle  ; that  is, as twice  the plane EF  drawn  into  the dis
tance  PS,  or  as the sum  of the equal  planes EF  +  ef drawn  into  the same
distance.  And,  by a like reasoning,  the  forces  of  all the  planes  in  the
whole  sphere,  equi-distant  on  each  side from  the centre  of the  sphere,  are
as the sum  of those  planes drawn  into  the  distance  PS,  that  is, as  the
whole  sphere  and  the distance  PS  conjunctly.  Q,.E.D.
  CASE  2. Let now  the corpuscle  P  attract  the sphere AEBF.   And, by
the same  reasoning,  it will appear  that  the  force with which  the sphere  is
attracted  is as  the distance PS.  Q,.E.D.
  CASE  3. Imagine  another  sphere composed  of innumerable  corpuscles  P  :
and  because  the  force  with  which  every  corpuscle  is attracted  is as the  dis
tance  of the corpuscle  from  the centre  of the  first sphere, and  as the  same
sphere  conjunctly,  and  is therefore  the same  as  if it all proceeded  from  a
single corpuscle  situate  in  the centre  of  the  sphere, the  entire  force with
which  all the corpuscles  in the  second  sphere  are  attracted,  that  is, with
which  that whole  sphere  is attracted,  will be the  same  as  if that  sphere

  CASE  5. Let  the  corpuscle p  be  placed within  ^-    ^\E

force compounded  of both  will  be as  the difference    **
of the  solids,  that  is, as the sum  of the  equal  planes drawn  into  half  the
difference  of the distances  ; that  is, as that sum  drawn  into joS, the distance
of the corpuscle  from  the centre  of  the sphere.  And,  by a like  reasoning,
the attraction  of all the  planes EF,  ef, throughout  the whole  sphere,  that
is, the attraction  of the whole  sphere,  is conjunctly  as  the sum  of  all  the

as before,  that  the  attraction, whether  single  of  one  sphere  towards  the

   given  distances from  the  centre  ; and  the  attractive  force  of  evsrt/

the  triangles SPH,  SHI  are  alike,

Therefore  the  entire  force with  ,7hich  the corpuscle  P  is attracted  towards

the centre  of  the sphere  is as-^,   that   is, reciprocally   as  PS3    X   PJ
Q.E.I.
   By  the same  method  one may  determine  the  attraction  of  a  corpuscle
situate  within  the sphere,  but more  expeditiously  by the following  Theorem.

        PROPOSITION  LXXXIL   THEOREM   XLI.

In  a sphere  described  about  the centre  S with  the interval  SA,  if there  be
   taken  SI, SA, SP  continually  proportional  ; ! sat/, that  the  attraction,
   of a corpuscle  within  the sphere  in any  place  I is to its attraction  without
   the sphere  in  the place  P in  a  ratio compounded  of the subduplicate
   ratio  of IS, PS,  the distances from  the  centre, and  the  subduplicate
   ratio  of tJie centripetal  forces  tending  to the  centre  in  those places P
   and  I.

   As  if the  centripetal  forces  of  the
particles  of the sphere  be  reciprocally
;is the  distances  of the  corpuscle  at
tracted  by them  ; the  force with  which
the corpuscle  situate  in I is attracted
by the  entire  sphere  will  be  to  the
force  with  which  it is attracted  in P
in a ratio compounded  of the  subdu
plicate  ratio  of the distance  SI  to the  distance  SP, and  the  subduplicate
ratio  of the centripetal  force  in the place  I arising from  any  particle  in the
centre  to the centripetal  force  in the place P arising from  the same  particle  in
the centre ; that  is, in the subduplicate  ratio  of the distances  SI, SP  to each
other reciprocally.  These  two  subduplicate  ratios compose  the  ratio  of
equality,  and  therefore  the attractions  in I and  P  produced  by the  whole
sphere  are equal.  By  the  like  calculation,  if the  forces  of  the particles  of
the sphere  are  reciprocally  in a duplicate  ratio  of  the  distances,  it will  be
found  that  the attraction  in I is to the attraction  in P  as the  distance SP

to the semi -diameter  SA  of the sphere.  If those  forces  are  reciprocally  in
a triplicate  ratio  of the distances,  the  attractions  in I and  P  will  be to each
other  as SP2   to SA3  ; if in  a quadruplicate  ratio, as SP3  to SA3.  There
fore  since  the  attraction  in P  was  found  in this  last case  to be reciprocally
 as PS 3 X  PI, the attraction  in I will  be reciprocally  as S A 3 X  PI, that  is,
 because  S A 3 is given  reciprocally  as PI.  And  the progression  is the same
 in injinitnm.  The  demonstration  of this Theorem   is as follows  :
   The  things remaining  as above  constructed,  and  a corpuscle  being  in anj

 \vill be  still  less increased  by  it, if the  attraction,  in the  recess  of  the body
 attracted,  decreases  in  a  still less proportion.  The  proposition,  therefore,
 is evident  concerning  attractive  spheres.  And  the case  is the same  of con
cave  sphaerical  orbs  attracting  external  bodies.  And  much  more  does  it
appear  in orbs  that  attract  bodies  placed  within  them,  because  there  the
 attractions  diffused  through  the  cavities  of those  orbs  are (by Prop. LXX)
destroyed  by contrary  attractions,  and  therefore  have  no  effect  even  in the
place  of contact.  Now   if from  these spheres  and  sphoerical  orbs we  take
away  any  parts remote  from  the place  of contact, and  add  new  parts  any
where  at  pleas ore, we  may  change  the figures of  the  attractive  bodies  at
pleasure ; but  the  parts added  or taken  away,  being remote  from  the place
of contact,  will  cause  no remarkable  excess  of  the  attraction  arising from

the contact  of the two bodies.   '1 herefore  the  proposition  holds  good  in
bodies  of all figures.  Q.E.I).

       PROPOSITION   LXXXV1.   THEOREM   XLIII.

If the forces  of the particles  of which  an  attractive  body  is composed  de
   crease,  in. the  recess  of the attractive  body,  in a triplicate  or more  than
   a triplicate  ratio  of the distance from  the particles,  the  attraction  will
   be vastly  stronger  in  the point  of contact  than when  the attracting  and
   attracted  bodies  are  separated from  each  other, though  by never  so
   small  an  interval.
   For  that  the attraction  is infinitely  increased  when  the attracted  corpus
cle comes  to touch  an  attracting  sphere  of  this  kind,  appears,  by the solu
tion  of Problem  XLI,  exhibited  in ££e second  and  third Examples.  The
same  will  also appear  (by comparing  those Examples  and  Theorem  XLI
together)  of attractions  of bodies made  towards  concavo-convex  orbs, whether
the attracted  bodies  be placed without  the orbs, or  in  the  cavities  within
them.  And  by aiding  to or taking from  those  spheres  and  orbs  any  at
tractive  matter  any  where  without  the  place  of contact,  so that  the  attrac
tive bodies may  receive  any  assigned  figure, the Proposition  will hold good
of all bodies  universally.  Q.E.D.

       PROPOSITION   LXXXVII.   THEOREM   XI. IV.

 If two  bodies  similar  to each  other, and  consisting  of matter  equally  at

   and  in a like situation  to them,  the accelerative  attractions  of  the  cor

   of the corpuscles  towards  particles  of the  bodies  proportional  to  the

  For  if the  bodies  are divided  into  particles proportional  to  the  wholes,
and  alike  situated  in them,  it will  be, as the  attraction  towards  any  parti

A X AZ  will (by Cor.  2, of the Laws)  be resolved  into  the forces A X GZ

placed  in their common  centre  of gravity  G, composing  there  a little globe.
  By  the same  reasoning,  if there  be added  a third  particle  G, and  the

force  of it be compounded  with  the  force A  -f B X GZ  tending  to the  cen

globe and  the  particle C  were  placed  in  that common  centre  composing  a
greater  globe  there ; and  so we  may  go  on  in injinitum.  Therefore
the  whole  force  of  all the  particles  of any body whatever RSTV   is the
same  as  if that  body, without  removing  its centre  of gravity,  were  to put

If to the  several  points  of any  circle  there  tend  equal  centripeta    forces,

I ,et the spheroids  have  all one common   axis, and  the  parts  of  the  right
lines intercepted  on both  sides DP  and BE, FP  and CG, DH  and  IE, FK

Conceive  now DPF.  EPG   to represent  opposite  cones  described  with  the

P, and  will therefore  attract  that corpuscle  equally.  And  by a  like  rea
soning  if the spaces DPF, EGCB   be divided  into  particles by the superfi
cies of innumerable  similar  spheroidsJ.concentric  to the former  and  havingO
one common   axis,  all these  particles  will  equally  attract  on both  sides  the

and  of the conic segment EGCB,  are  equal, and  by their  contrariety  de
stroy  each other.  And  the  case  is the same  of the  forces  of all the matter
that  lies without  the  interior  spheroid PCBM.   Therefore  the  body  P  is
attracted  by the  interior  spheroid PCBM   alone, and  therefore  (by Cor.  3,

the attraction  of that  nearer  part  will, as the  distance  increases,  decrease
nearly  in the  ratio  of the power CGn—   3.
   Con.  3. And  hence  if any  finite body, plane  on  one  side, attract  a  cor
puscle  situate  over  against  the middle  of that plane, and  the distance  between
the corpuscle  and  the plane compared  with  the dimensions  of the attracting
body  be extremely  small  ; and  the attracting  body  consist  of homogeneous
particles, whose  attractive  forces  decrease  in the  ratio  of any  power  of  the
distances  greater  than  the quadruplicate ; the  attractive  force  of the whole
body  will decrease  very  nearly  in the ratio  of  a power  whose  side  is that
very  small  distance,  and  the index  less by 3 than  the  index  of  the former
power.  This  assertion  does  not hold  good, however,  of a body  consisting
of particles  whose  attractive  forces  decrease  in the  ratio  of the  triplicate
power  of the distances  ; because,  in that  case, the attraction  of the remoter
part  of the  infinite body  in the second  Corollary  is always  infinitely  greater
than  the attraction  of the  nearer  part.


                      SCHOLIUM.

   If a body  is attracted  perpendicularly  towards  a given  plane, and  from
the law  of attraction  given,  the motion  of the body  be  required  ; the Pro
blem  will  be solved  by seeking  (by Prop. XXXIX)   the motion  of the body
descending  in  a right  line towards  that  plane, and  (by Cor.  2, of the Laws)
compounding  that motion  with  an uniform  motion  performed  in the direc
tion  of lines  parallel  to that plane.  And,  on the  contrary,  if there  be  re
quired  the law  of the  attraction  tending  towards  the plane  in perpendicu
lar directions, by which  the  body may  be caused  to move  in  any  given
curve  line, the Problem  will  be solved  by working  after  the manner   of the
third Problem.

   But  the  operations  may  be contracted  by resolving  the  ordinates  into
converging  series.  As  if to a  base A  the length B  be  ordinately  ap
plied  in any given  angle, and  that  length  be  as  any power  of the  base

A^  ; and  there  be sought  the  force with  which  a body,  either  attracted  to
wards  the base  or driven  from  it in the direction  of that  ordinate, may  be
caused  to move  in the curre  line which  that ordinate  always  describes  with
its superior  extremity  ; I suppose  the  base  to be  increased  by  a very  small

—  1, the force  will be as 2 A    3 or 2B  3 ; and  therefore  a force which  is as the
cube  of the ordinate  will cause  the body  to move  in an hyperbola.  But
leaving  this kind  of propositions,  I shall  go on  to some  others  relating  to
motion  which  I have  fiot yet touched  upon.

        PROPOSITION   XCIV.   THEOREM   XLVIII.

If two  similar mediums   be separated from  each  other  by  a space  termi
  nated  on  both  sides  by parallel  planes,  and  a  body  in  its passage
  through  that  space  be attracted  or impelled  perpendicularly  towards
   either  of those mediums,  and  not  agitated  or hindered  by any  other
  force  ; and  the attraction  be every  where  the same  at equal  distances
  from  either plane,  taken  towards  the same  hand  of the plane ; I say,
   that  the sine  of incidence  upon  either plane  will  be to the sine of emcr
   gence from  the  other plane  in  a given  ratio.
  CASE  1. Let Aa  and  B6  be two  parallel  planes,
and  let the body  light upon  the  first plane Aa  in
the direction  of  the  line GH,  and  in  its whole
passage  through  the intermediate  space  let  it be
attracted  or impelled  towards  the medium  of in
cidence,  and  by that  action  let  it be made  to de
scribe  a curve  line HI, and  let it emerge  in the di

                      SCHOLIUM.

   These  attractions  bear  a great resemblance  to the  reflexions  and  refrac
 tions  of light made  in  a given  ratio  of the  secants,  as was  discovered  h}
 Siiellius  ; and  consequently  in  a given  ratio  of the  sines,  as was  exhibited

by Hes  Cortes.  For  it is now  certain from  the phenomena  of Jupiter's
^satellites, confirmed  by the observations  of different  astronomers,  that light
 is propagated  in succession,  and  requires  about  seven  or  eight minutes  to
 travel from  the sun  to the earth.  Moreover,  the rays  of light  that  are  in
 our  air (as lately was  discovered  by Grimaldus,  by  the admission  of light
 into  a dark  room  through  a small  hole, which  1 have  also  tried) in  their
 passage  near  the angles  of bodies, whether  transparent  or opaque  (such  aa
 the circular and  rectangular  edges  of  gold, silver and  brass  coins,  or  of
 knives,  or broken  pieces  of stone  or  glass), are bent  or inflected  round  those
 bodies  as  if they  were  attracted  to them  ; and  those  rays  which  in  their
 passage  come  nearest  to the bodies  are  the most  inflected,  as  if they were
 most  attracted  : which  tiling I myself  have  also  carefully observed.  And
 those  which  pass  at greater  distances  are  less  inflected  ; and  those  at  still
 greater  distances  are  a  little  inflected  the  contrary  way, and  form  three
 fringes  of colours.  In the  figure  5 represents  the edge  of a  knife,  or  any

 wards  the knife  in the  arcs  owo,  nvn, mtm,  Isl ; which  inflection  is greater
 or less according;  to their  distance  from  the knife.  Now  since  this  inflec
 tion  of the rays  is performed  in the  air without  the knife,  it follows  that  the
 rays which  fall upon  the knife  are  first inflected  in the  air before  they touch
 the knife.  And  the  case  is the same  of the rays falling upon  glass.  The
 refraction,  therefore,  is made  not  in the point  of incidence,  but gradually, by
 a continual  inflection  of the rays  ; which  is done  partly  in the  air before  they
 touch  the  glass, partly  (if [ mistake  not) within  the glass, after  they have
 entered  it ; as  is represented  in  the  rays  ckzc,  bujb^ ahxa,  falling upon  r,
 q, p, and  inflected  between  k and  z, i and  y, h and x.  Therefore  because
 of the analogy  there  is between  the propagation  of the rays  f light and  the
 motion  of bodies,  I thought  it not  amiss  to add  the followi  »g Propositions
 far optical  uses  ; not  at  all. considering  the nature  of the rays  of .light,  or
 inquiring  whether  they are  bodies  or not ; but  only determining  the  tra
 jectories  of bodies  which  are extremely  like  the trajectories  of the  rays.

   a superficies  as may  cause  all  the corpuscles  issuing from  any  one
   given  place  to converge  to another  given  place.
   Let A  be the  place from  whence  the cor-        E
puscles  diverge  ; B  the place  to which  they
should  converge  ; CDE   the curve  line which
by its revolution  round  the axis AB  describes    ./C

the  line DF  by which AD   is increased,  to the  line DG  by which  DB   is

   For  conceive  the  lines CP, CQ   to be every  where  perpendicular  to AD,

 as M  to N, and  therefore  as DL  to DK,  or FB  to FK   ; and by division  as
 DL  —  FB  or PH  —  PD  —  FB   to FD  or FQ  —  QD   ; arid by composition
 as PH—  FB  to FQ,  that  is (because PH  and  CG, QS  and CE,  are  equal),
 as CE  +  BG  —  FR   to CE  — FS.  But  (because BG   is to CE  as M —
N  to N)  it. comes  to  pass  also  that CE  + BG   is to CE  as M  to N;  and
therefore,  by division, FR   is to FS  as M  to N ; and  therefore  (by Cor.  2,
Prop  XCVI1)  the  superficies EF  compels  a body,  falling upon  it in  the
direction DF,  to go  on  in the  line FR   to the place B.  Q.E.D.

   ,In the same  manner  one  may  go on  to three  or more  superficies.  But
of  all figures  the sphserical  is the most  proper  for optical uses.  If the ob
ject glasses  of telescopes were  made  of two  glasses  of  a  sphaerical  figure,
containing  water  between  them,  it is not  unlikely  that  the  errors  of  the
refractions  made  in the extreme  parts  of the  superficies  of  the glasses may
be accurately  enough  corrected  by  the refractions  of  the water.  Such  ob
ject glasses  are  to be preferred  before  elliptic and  hyperbolic  glasses, not only
because  they may  be formed  with  more  ease  and  accuracy,  but  because  the
pencils  of rays  situate  without  the  axis  of  the glass would  be more  accu
rately  refracted  by them.  But  the  different  refrangibility  of different  raya
is the  real obstacle  that hinders  optics from  being made  perfect by sphaeri
cal  or any  other  figures.  Unless  the  errors  thence  arising  can be corrected,
all the labour  spent  in correcting  the  others  is quite thrown  away.

Of  the motion  of  bodies   that   are  resisted  in  the  ratio  of the  velocity.

            PROPOSITION    I.  THEOREM    I.

Tf a body  is resisted  in  the  ratio  of  its  velocity,  the motion  lost by  re
   sistance  is as  the space  gone  over  in  its motion.
   For  since  the motion  lost in each  equal  particle  of time  is as the velocity,
that  is, as the  particle  of space  gone  over, then, by composition,  the motion
lost in the whole  time  will he  as the whole  space  gone  over.  Q.E.D.
  COR.  Therefore  if the body,  destitute  of all gravity, move  by  its innate
force only  in free  spaces,  and  there  be given  both  its whole  motion  at  the
beginning,  and  also  the motion  remaining  after some  part  of the way  is
gone  over, there  will  be given  also  the whole  space  which  the body  can  de
scribe  in an  infinite time.  For  that space  will  be  to  the  space now  de
scribed  as the whole  motion  at the beginning  is to  the  part  lost of that
motion.

Quantities  proportional  to their  differences  are  continually  proportional.

version, A  will be to B  as B  to C  and  C  to D,  &c.   Q.E.D.

   the  velocities  in the beginning  of each  of the times  are  in  a geometri

 the particles  of time  will  be as the same  velocity.  Therefore  the  veloci
 ties are  proportional  to  their  differences, and  therefore  (by Lem.  1, Book
 II) continually  proportional.  Therefore  if out  of an  equal number  of par
 ticles there  be compounded  any  equal  portions  of time,  the  velocities  at the
 beginning  of those  times  will  be  as terms  in  a continued  progression,  which
 are taken  by intervals,  omitting  every  where  an  equal number  of interme
 diate terms.  But  the  ratios  of these  terms  are compounded  of the  equaj
 ratios  of the intermediate  terms  equally  repeated,  and  therefore  are equal
 Therefore  the  velocities, being  proportional  to those  terms,  are  in geomet
 rical progression.  Let  those  equal  particles  of time  be  diminished,  and
 their number  increased  in infinitum,  so that  the impulse  of resistance may
become  continual  ; and  the  velocities  at the beginnings  of equal  times,  al
ways  continually  proportional,  will  be  also  in  this  case  continually  pro
portional.  Q.E.D.
   CASE  2. And,  by division,  the  differences  of the  velocities,  that  is, the
parts  of the  velocities  lost in each  of the  times,  are  as the wholes ; but  the
spaces  described  in each  of the times  are  as the  lost parts  of  the  velocities
(by Prop.  1, Book   I), and  therefore  are  also  as the  wholes.    Q.E.D.
TT       COROL.  Hence  if to the rectangular  asymptotes  AC, CH,
                 the hyperbola BG   is described,  and AB, DG  be drawn  per
               pendicular  to the asymptote  AC,  and  both  the  velocity  of
               . the body, and  the resistance  of the medium,  at the  very  be
               ginning  of the motion,  be  expressed  by any  given  line AC,
and,  after some  time  is elapsed, by the indefinite  line DC  ; the  time may
be expressed by  the area ABGD,  and  the  space described  in that  time by
the  line AD.   For  if that  area, by the motion  of the point  D, be uniform
ly increased  in the same  manner  as the time, the  right  line DC   will de
crease  in  a geometrical  ratio  in the same  manner  as the  velocity  ; and  the
parts of  the  right  line AC,  described  in equal  times,  will decrease  in  the
same  ratio.

  descends  in  a right  line, and  is resisted  in  the ratio  of its velocity, and

G, g ; and  the body  ascending  will in  the  time DGgd  describe  the space
EG«-e;  in the time DGBA,   the space  of  the whole  ascent EGB  ; in  the
time ABK1,  the space  of descent BFK  ; and  in the time IKki  the space  of
descent KFfk;  and  the velocities  of the  bodies  (proportional  to the  re
sistance  of the medium)  in these  periods  of time  will  be ABED,  ABed,  O,
ABFI,  AB/z  respectively  ; and  the  greatest  velocity which  the body  can
acquire by descending  will be BACH.
   For  let the rectangle BACH   be resolved  into in

numerable  rectangles  AA', K/, Lm,  M//,  *fea, which
shall  be as the increments  of the  velocities  produced
 in so many  equal  times;  then  will  0, AAr, AL Am,  An,
 ifec., be as the whole  velocities,  and  therefore  (by suppo
sition)  as the  resistances  of  the medium  in  the  be-
ginning  of each  of  the equal  times.   Make  AC to   AJLLB
AK,  or ABHC   to AB/vK,  as the  force  of gravity  to the  resistance  in the
beginning  of the second  time ; then  from  the  force  of gravity  subduct  the
 resistances,  and ABHC,  K/vHC,  L/HC, MwHC,    (fee., will  be  as the  abso
 lute  forces  with  which  the body  is acted upon  in the beginning  of each  of
 the  times, and  therefore  (by Law  I) as the increments  of the velocities,  that

 is, as the rectangles  AA-, K/, Lm,  M//,  (fee., and  therefore  (by Lem.  1, Book
 II) in  a geometrical  progression.  Therefore,  if the  right  lines K£,  LI
 M/TO, N//, &c.,  are produced  so as  to meet  the  hyperbola  in q, r, s, t, (fee..
 the  areas AB^K,  K</rL, LrsM,  MsJN,   (fee., will  be  equal, and  there
 fore analogous  to the equal  times and  equal  gravitating  forces.  But  the
 area AB^K   (by Corol.  3, Lem.  VII  and  VIII, Book  I) is to the  area Bkq
 as K^  to \kq,  or AC  to |AK,  that  is, as the  force  of gravity  to the  resist
 ance  in the middle  of the  first time.  And  by the  like reasoning,  the  areas
 <?KLr, rLMs,  sMN/,   (fee., are  to  the  areas  qklr, rims,  smnt,   (fee., as  the
 gravitating  forces  to the resistances  in the middle  of the second,  third, fourth
 time, and  so on.  Therefore  since  the  equal  areas BAKq,  </KLr, rLMs,
 sMN/,   (fee., are  analogous  to the  gravitating  forces, the  areas Bkq,  qklr,
 rims,  smut,   (fee., will  be analogous  to the  resistances  in the middle  of
 each  of the  times,  that  is (by supposition),  to the  velocities, and  so  to  the
 spaces described.  Take  the sums  of  the analogous  quantities,  and  the areas
 Bkq,  Elr, Ems,  But,  (fee., will  be analogous  to the whole  spaces described  ;
 and  also the  areas AB<?K,  ABrL,  ABsM,  AB^N,   (fee., to the times.  There
 fore  the body,  in descending,  will in any  time ABrL   describe  the space  Blr,
 and  in the time Lr^N  the space rlnt.  Q,.E.D.  And  the  like demonstra
 tion  holds  in ascending  motion.
   COROL.  1. Therefore  the greatest  velocity  that  the body  can  acquire by
 falling  is to the velocity  acquired  in any  given  time  as the  £iven  force  ol
 gravity  which  perpetually  acts upon  it to the  resisting  force which  opposes
  it at the end  of that  time.

RDGT   and  (by Laws,  Cor.  2), distinguish  the motion  of the body  into
two  others,  one  of ascent,  the  other lateral.  And  since  the resistance  is as
the motion,  let that  also  be distinguished  into two  parts  proportional  and
contrary  to the  parts  of the motion  : and  therefore  the length  described  by
the  lateral motion  will  be (by Prop.  II, Book  II) as the  line DR,  and  the
height  (by Prop.  Ill, Book  II) as the  area DR  X  AB  —  RDGT,   that  is,
as the  line Rr.  But  in the very beginning  of the motion  the  area RDGT
is equal  to  the  rectangle DR  X  AQ,  and  therefore  that  line Rr  (or

that  is, as CP  to DC  ; and  therefore  as the motion  upwards  to  the motion
lengthwise  at the beginning.  Since,  therefore, Rr  is always  as the  height,
and DR  always  as the length, and  Rr  is to DR   at  the beginning  as  the
height  to the length,  it follows,  that Rr  is always  to DR   as the  height  to
the length  ; and  therefore  that  the body  will move  in the  line DraF.  which
is the  locus  of the point r.  QJE.D.

if the  parallelogram ACPY   be  completed,  and DY  cutting CP  in Z  be

proportional  to the velocity  in any  place  r.
   COR.  6. But  since  the length 2DP   is to the  latus  rectum  of the  para
bola  as the gravity  to  the  resistance  in D ; and, from  the  velocity  aug
mented,  the resistance  is  'ti gmented  in the same  ratio, but  the latus rectum
of the parabola  is augmented  in the duplicate  of that  ratio, it is plain thot
the length 2DP   is augmented  in that simple  ratio  only ; and  is therefore
always  proportional  to the velocity  ; nor  will  it be augmented  or dimin
ished by the change  of the angle CDP,  unless  the velocity  be also changed.
   COR.  7. Hence  appears  the method  of deter
mining  the  curve DraF  nearly from  the  phe-
nomena,  and  thence  collecting  the resistance  and
velocity  with  which  the body  is projected.  Let
two  similar  and  equal  bodies  be projected  with
the same  velocity, from  the  place  D, in  differ
ent angles CDP,  CDp  ; and  let the  places F,
f. where  they  fall upon  the  horizontal  plane
DC,  be known.  Then  taking  any length  for D       */  F
DP  or Dp  suppose  the resistance  in D  to be  to
the suavity  in any  ratio whatsoever,  and  let that
ratio  be expounded  by any length  SM.     Then,                  ,                             _
by computation,  from  that assumed  length DP,      ^x
findF/ the lengths DF, D/;  and  from  the  ratio

-p^, found  by calculation,  subduct  the same  ratio  as found  by experiment  ;

and  let the  cKfference  be expounded  by the perpendicular MN.   Repeat  the
same  a second  and  a third  time, by assuming  always  a new  ratio SM  of the
 resistance  to the gravity,  and  collecting  a new  difference MN.  Draw  the
 affirmative  differences  on  one  side of the  right  line SM,  and  the  negative
 on  the  other  side ; and  through  the points  N, N, N, draw  a  regular  curve
NNN.  cutting  the right  line SMMM   in X, and SX  will  be the  true  ratio
 of the resistance  to the gravity, which  was  to be found.  From  this  ratio
 the length DF   is to be collected  by calculation  ; and  a length, which  is to
 the assumed  length DP  as  the  length DF  known  by experiment  to  the
 length DF  just now  found,  will  be the  true length DP.   This  being known,
 you  will have  both  the curve  line DraF  which  the body  describes, and  also
 the velocity  and  resistance  of the body  in each  place.

    But,  yet, that  the resistance  of bodies  is in the ratio  of the velocity,  is more
 a mathematical  hypothesis  than  a physical one.  In mediums  void  of all te

 tion to a greater  velocity  is communicated  to the same  quantity  of  the
 medium  in a less time  ; and  in an  equal  time, by reason  of a greater quan
 tity of the disturbed  medium,  a motion  is communicated  in the  duplicate
 ratio greater  ; and  the  resistance  (by Law  II and  III) is as  the motion
 communicated.  Let  us, therefore,  see what  motions  arise from  this law  of
 resistance.

            PROPOSITION    V.  THEOREM    III.

 Ff a body  is resisted  in the duplicate  ratio of  its velocity, and  moves  by
    its innate force  only through  a  similar medium;  and  the times  be
   taken  in a geometrical  progression,  proceeding from  less  to greater
   terms  : I say,  that  the velocities  at the beginning  of each  of the times
   are in the same  geometrical  progression  inversely  ; and  that  the spaces
   are  equal, which  are described  in each  of the times.
   For  since  the resistance  of the medium   is proportional  to the square  of
 the velocity, and  the decrement  of the velocity  is proportional  to the  resist
ance  : if the time  be divided  into innumerable  equal  particles,  the squares  of
the  velocities  at the beginning  of each  of the times  will be proportional  to
the differences  of the same  velocities.    Let  those  particles  of time  be AK,
                       KL,  LM,  &c., taken  in  the right  line CD;  and
                            erect  the perpendiculars  AB,  Kk,  L/, Mm,  &c.,
                         meeting  the hyperbola BklmG,  described  with  the
                            centre  C, and  the rectangular  asymptotes  CD, CH.

  C  ARIMT      toto CA^A> ; an(1and alternate^therefore  asABAB — X ^CKk toto AKAB  Xas CA.Kk

Therefore  since AK  and AB  X CA  are  given,* AB  —  Kk  will  be  as AB

           PROPOSITION    VII.  THEOREM    V.

 If spherical  bodies  are  resisted  in  the duplicate  ratio  of their  velocities,
    in times  which  are  as  the first motions  directly, and  the first  resist
   ances  inversely,  they  will  lose parts  of their motions  proportional   to the
   wholes,  and  will describe  spaces  proportional  to those  times  and  the
   first velocities  conjunct  It/.
   For  the  parts  of the motions  lost  are  as the  resistances  and  times  con
 junctly.  Therefore,  that  those  parts may  be proportional  to  the  wholes,
 the resistance  and  time  conjunctly  ought  to be as the motion.  Therefore  the
 time  will  be  as the motion  directly  and  the  resistance  inversely.  Where
 fore  the  particles  of  the times  being  taken  in that  ratio, the  bodies  will
 always  loso parts  of their motions  proportional  to  the  wholes, and  there
 fore  will  retain  velocities  always  proportional  to  their  first  velocities.
 And  because  of the given  ratio  of the  velocities, they  will always  describe
 spaces  which  are  as the  first velocities  and  the times conjunctly.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Therefore  if bodies  equally  swift  are  resisted  in a duplicate  ra
 tio of  their  diameters,  homogeneous  globes moving  with  any  velocities
 whatsoever,  by describing  spaces  proportional  to their  diameters,  will  lose
 parts  of their motions  proportional  to the wholes.  For  the motion  of each
  o-lobe  will be  as its velocity and  mass  conjunctly,  that  is, as the  velocity
 and  the cube  of its diameter  ; the resistance  (by supposition)  will  be as the
 square  of the diameter  and  the square  of the velocity  conjunctly  ; and  the
 •time  (by this proposition)  is in the former  ratio  directly, and  in the  latter
 inversely,  that  is, as the diameter  directly  and  the velocity  inversely ; and

   COR.  3. And  universally,  if equally  swift  bodies  are  resisted  in the  ratio
 of any  power  of  the  diameters,  the  spaces, in which  homogeneous  globes,
moving  with  any  velocity  whatsoever,  will  lose parts  of their motions  pro
portional  to the wholes,  will  be  as  the  cubes  of  the  diameters  applied  to
that power.  Let  those  diameters  be D and  E  : and  if the resistances, where

the  velocities  are supposed  equal,  are  as  T)n and  E" ; the  spaces  in which
the globes, moving  with  any  velocities  whatsoever,  will  lose parts  of their

motions  proportional  to the wholes,  will  be as D3 —   n and  E3 —  n. And
therefore homogeneous  globes,  in describing  spaces  proportional  to D  3 —    n
and  E3 —  n, will retain  their  velocities  in the same  ratio  to one  another  as
at the beginning.
   COR.  4. Now   if the globes  are  not homogeneous,  the space  described by
the denser  globe must  be augmented  in the  ratio  of  the density.  For  the
motion,  with  an  equal  velocity,  is greater  in the ratio  of the  density, and
the time  (by this Prop.)  is augmented  in the  ratio of motion  directly, and
the space  described  in the  ratio  of the  time.
   COR.  5. And  if the  globes move  in  different  mediums,  the  space,  in  a
medium  which,  cccteris paribus,  resists  the  most, must  be diminished  in the
ratio  of the greater  resistance.  For  the  time  (by this  Prop.)  will  be  di
minished  in the  ratio  of the augmented  resistance,  and  the space  in the  ra
tio of the  time.

The moment  of any  genitum  is equal  to the moments  of each  of the gen-
   eratinrr  sides drawn  into  the indices  of the powers  of those  sides, and
   into  their  co-efficients continually.
   I call any  quantity  a genitum  which  is not  made  by addition  or  sub-
duction  of divers  parts, but  is generated  or produced  in arithmetic  by the
multiplication,  division,  or extraction  of the  root  of any  terms  whatsoever   :
in geometry  by  the invention  of contents  and  sides,  or  of the extremes  and
means  of proportionals.  Quantities  of  this kind  are  products,  quotients,
roots,  rectangles,  squares,  cubes, square  and  cubic  sides, and  the  like.
These  quantities  I here  consider  as variable  and indetermined,  and  increas
ing or decreasing,  as it were, by  a perpetual  motion  or flux ; and  I under
stand  their momentaneous  increments  or decrements  by the name  of mo
ments  ; so  that the increments  may  be esteemed  as added  or  affirmative
moments  ; and  the decrements  as subducted  or  negative  ones.  But  take
care  not  to look  upon  finite  particles  as such.  Finite  particles  are  not
moments,  but  the  very  quantities  generated  by the moments.  We  are  to
conceive  them  as the just nascent  principles  of finite magnitudes.  Nor  do
we  in this Lemma  regard  the magnitude  of  the moments,  but  their  firsf

 we  use  either  the  velocities  of  the increments  and  decrements  (which may

 finite quantities  proportional  to those  velocities.  The  co-efficient  of any
 generating  side  is the quantity  which  arises by applying  the genitum  to

    Wherefore  the  sense  of the Lemma   is, that  if the moments   of any quan

 yet, there wanted  of the sides A  and  B  half  their moments  \a and  \b, was
 A —  \a into B —  \b, or AB  —  ±a B —  \b A  +  \ab ; but  as soon  as  the

 comes  A  4- 4-a into  B  4- \b, or AB  -f ^a  B  4- \b A  -f \ab.  From   this
 rectangle  subduct  the  former  rectangle,  and  there  will remain  the  exces.?   A

selves; and  the moment  «B  +  />A, of A2,  that  is, of the  rectangle AB,
 will  be 2aA  ; and  the moment  aBC  + bAC  + cAB  of A3,  that  is, of  the
content ABC,  will be 3aA2.  And  by the same  reasoning  the moment   of

  to the drawing  of tangents  to any  curve  lines, whether  geometrical   or
 mechanical,  or any  how  respecting  right  lines  or  other  cnrves,  but  also
  to the resolving  other  abstrnser  kinds  of problems  about  the crookedness,
 areas,  lengths,  centres  of gravity  of curves,  &c. ; nor  is it (as Hudd^ri's
 method  de Maximis  &  Minimia)  limited  to equations  which  are  free from
 surd  quantities.  This  method  I have  interwoven  with  that  other  oj
 working  in equations,  by reducing  them  to infinite serie?.  So  far that
 letter.  And  these  last words  relate  to  a treatise  I composed  on  that  sub
 ject in the year 1671.  The  foundation  of that  general method   is contain
 ed in the preceding Lemma.

           PROPOSITION    VIII.  THEOREM    VI.

 If a body  in an uniform  medium,  being uniformly  acted upon  by  the force
    of gravity,  ascends  or descends  in  a right  line  ; and  the whole  space
   described  be distinguished  into equal  parts, and  in  the beginning  of
   each  of the parts  (by adding   or subducting  the resisting  force  of the
   medium   to or from  the force  of gravity,  when  the body  ascends  or de
   scends]  yon  collect  the absolute  forces ;  I say, that  those  absolute  forces
    ire in  a geometrical  progression.
                        For  let the force  of gravity  be expounded  by  the
                       given  line AC  ; the  force  of resistance  by the  indefi
                          nite  line AK  ; the absolute  force  in  the descent  of the
                      body by the  difference KC  : the  velocity  of  the   I tody
     <^LKJL&i>F/    by a line AP,  which  shall  be  a mean  proportional  be
 tween AK  and AC,  and  therefore  in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the resistance;
 the increment  of the  resistance  made  in  a given  particle  of time  by  the  li-
neola KL,  and  the contemporaneous  increment  of the  velocity by  the  li-
neola PQ  ; and  with  the centre  C, and  rectangular  asymptotes  CA, CH,
describe  any hyperbola BNS  meeting  the  erected  perpendiculars  AB, KN,
LO  in B, N and O.  Because AK   is as AP2  , the moment  KL  of the  one  will
be as the moment  2APQ   of the  other, that  is, as AP  X KC  ; for  the  in
crement PQ   of the velocity  is (by Law  II) proportional  to  the generating
force KC.   Let  the  ratio  of KL  be compounded  with  the  ratio KN,  and
the rectangle KL  X KN  will become  as AP  X KC  X KN   ; that  is (because
the rectangle KC  X KN   is given),  as AP.  But  the ultimate  ratio  of the
hyperbolic  area KNOL   to  the  rectangle KL  X KN  becomes, when  the
points K  and  L  coincide,  the  ratio  of equality.  Therefore  that hyperbolic
evanescent  area  is as AP.  Therefore  the whole  hyperbolic  area ABOL
is composed  of  particles KNOL   which  are  always  proportional  to  the
velocity AP;  and  therefore  is  itself proportional  to  the  space  described
with  that  velocity.  Let  ,that  area  be now  divided  into  equal  parts

   angles  of the  sector  of a  circle, and  of an  hyperbola,  be taken  propor
   tional  to the  velocities,  the radius  being  of a fit magnitude,   all the time
   of the ascent  to the highest  place  icill be as  the  sector  of the  circle, and
   all the time  of descending  from  the highest  place  as  the  sector  of  t/ie
   hyperbola.
   To   the  right   line  AC,  which   ex
presses  the  force  of gravity,  let AD

vertex  A, and  asymptote DC.   Let Dp,

particle  of  the  sector, is as ^ , ; that  is, as the  least decrement  pq  of the

AP2.   But. from  the nature  of the hyperbola, DX2  — TX2   is AD2   ; and, by
 the supposition, AP2   is AD  X AK.   Therefore  the  particles  are  to  each

UK  ; and  therefore,  ex  cequo, LKNO   to DPQ,  as AP  to CK.   But DPQ
was  to DTV   as CK   to AC.   Therefore,  ex  aquo, LKNO   is to DTV     r,?
AP  to AC  ; that  is, as  the  velocity  of the  falling body  to  the  greatest
velocity which  the body  by  falling  can  acquire.  Since,  therefore,  the
moments LKNO   and DTV   of the  areas ABNK   and ATD   are as  the  ve
locities,  all the parts  of those  areas  generated  in  the same  time  will be  as
the spaces  described  in the same  time  ; and  therefore  the whole  areas ABNK
and ADT,  generated  from  the beginning,  will  be as the  whole  spaces  de
scribed  from  the beginning  of the descent.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  2. The  same  is true  also  of the  space  described  in  the  ascent.
That  is to say, that  all that  space  is to  the  space  described  in the same
time, with  the uniform  velocity AC,  as the  area ABttk   is to the sector ADt.
   COR.  3. The  velocity  of the body,  falling  in  the  time ATD,   is to  the
velocity which  it would  acquire  in the same  time  in  a non-resisting  space,
as the triangle APD   to the hyperbolic  sector ATD.   For  the  velocity  in
a non-resisting medium  Avould  be as the time ATD,  and  in  a resisting me
dium  is as AP,  that  is, as the  triangle APD.  And  those  velocities,  at the
beginning  of the  descent,  are  equal among  themselves,  as  well  as  those
areas ATD,  APD.
   COR.  4. By  the same  argument,  the velocity  in the ascent  is  to the  ve
locity with  which  the body  in the same  time,  in  a non-resisting  space, would
lose  all its motion  of ascent,  as  the  triangle ApD  to  the  circular  sector
AtD  ; or  as the right  line Ap  to the  arc  At.
   COR.  5. Therefore  the  time  in which  a body, by falling  in  a resisting
medium,  would  acquire  the  velocity AP,  is to the time  in which  it would
acquire  its greatest  velocity AC,  by falling  in  a non-resisting  space,  as the
sector ADT   to the triangle ADC   : and  the time  in which  it would  lose  its
velocity Ap, by ascending  in  a resisting medium,  is to  the  time  in which
it would  lose the same  velocity by ascending  in  a  non-resisting  space,  as
the  arc At  to  its tangent  Ap.
   COR.  6. Hence  from  the given  time  there  is given  the space described  in
the  ascent  or descent.  For  the greatest  velocity  of  a body descending  in
wfinitum   is given  (by Corol.  2 and  3, Theor.  VI, of this Book)  ; and  thence
the time  is given  in which  a body would  acquire  that  velocity by falling

           PROPOSITION    X.  PROBLEM    III.

Suppose  the uniform  force  of gravity  to tend  directly  to the plane  of the
   horizon,  and  the resistance  to be as  the density  of the medium  and  the
   square  of the velocity  coiijunctly  : it is proposed   to find  the density  of
   the medium   in each  place, which  shall make  the  body move  in any
  given  carve  line ; the  velocity of the body and  the  resistance  of the
  medium   in each  place.
                                         Let PQ  be  a plane perpendicular  to
                                            the plane  of the scheme  itself; PFHQ

                                      points P  and Q ; G, H,  I, K   four
                                        places  of  the body  going  on  in  this
                               \  curve  from  F  to Q  ; and  GB, HC,  ID,

p                  A.      33  c^D  E  Q from  these  points  to the  horizon,  and
standing  on  the horizontal  line PQ   at the points  B, C, D, E ; and  let the
distances  BC, CD,  DE,  of the  ordinates  be equal among  themselves.  From
the points G  and H  let the  right  lines GL, HN,  be drawn  touching  the
curve  in G  and  H, and  meeting  the ordinates  CH,  DI, produced  upwards,
in L  and  N  : and  complete  the parallelogram HCDM.   And  the  times  in
which  the body  describes  the- arcs GH,  HI,  will  be in  a subduplicate  ratio
of the  altitudes LH,  NI; which  the  bodies would  describe  in  those  times,
by falling from  the tangents;  and  the  velocities  will be  as the lengths  de
scribed GH,  HI  directly, and  the times  inversely.  Let  the  times  be  ex-                                                                  C*TT        TTT

of the velocity produced  in the  time  t will  be expounded  by  -7^        —   .
This  decrement  arises from  the resistance  which  retards  the body, and from
the gravity  which  accelerates  it.  Gravity,  in a falling body, which  in  its
fall describes  the space NI, produces  a velocity  with  which  it would  be able
to describe  twice  that  space  in  the same  time,  as Galileo  has demonstrated  ;

   Such  series  I distinguish  into  successive  terms  after  this manner  : I call
that  the  first term  in which  the  infinitely small  quantity  o is not  found  ;
the second,  in which  that quantity  is of one dimension  only ; the  third, in
which  it arises  to two  dimensions  ; the fourth,  in which  it is of three  ; and
so ad infinitum.  And  the  first term, which  here  is e, will  always  denote
the length  of the ordinate  CH,  standing  at the beginning  of  the  indefinite

quantity   o.  The  second  term, which  here  is —  , will denote  the difference

between CH  and DN  ; that  is, the lineola MN  which  is cut  off by com
pleting  the parallelogram  HC DM;  and  therefore  always  determines  theCM?

position  of the tangent HN  ; as, in this  case, by taking MN   to HM   as —G


to  o, or a  to e.  The  third  term, which  here  is -£—,  will represent  the  li
neola  IN, which  lies between  the tangent  and  the  curve  ; and  therefore
determines  the angle  of contact IHN,  or the curvature  which  the curve  line

has  in H.   If that  lineola  IN  is of a finite magnitude,  it will be expressed
by the  third  term,  together  with  those  that  follow  in wfinitu:.:i.  But  if
that  lineola  be diminished   in. infini-
tnm,  the terms  following  become  in
finitely  less than  the  third  term,  and
therefore may  be  neglected.  The
fourth  term  determines  the  variation
of the curvature  ; the  fifth, the  varia
tion  of  the  variation  ; and  so  on.

Whence,  by the  way,  appears  no con-p~"      ~K   B~C~D~E~

will  be  to the gravity  as 3a  to 2>/, that  is, as SAC   to the  diameter PQ  of
the circle; and  the velocity  will  be as  i/ CH.   Therefore  if the body  goes
from  the place F, with  a due  velocity,  in the direction  of a line parallel  to
PQ,  and  the density  of the medium  in each  of the places H  is as the length
of the tangent HT,  and  the resistance  also  in any  place H  is to the  force
of gravity  as SAC  to PQ,  that body  will  describe  the quadrant FHQ   of  a
circle.  Q.E.I.

   But  if the same  body  should  go-frorn  the place P, in  the  direction  of  a
line perpendicular  to PQ,  and  should  begin  to move  in an  arc  of the semi
circle PFQ,  we  must  take AC   or  a on  the contrary  side  of  the  centre  A  ;
and  therefore  its sign must  be  changed,  and  we  must  put —  a  for +   a.

Then  the density  of  the medium  would  come  out  as          .   But  nature

does  not admit  of a negative  density,  that  is, a density which  accelerates
 the motion  of bodies;  and  therefore  it cannot  naturally come  to pass  that
a body by ascending  from  P should  describe  the quadrant  PF  of  a  circle.
To  produce  such  an  effect, a body  ought  to be accelerated  by an impelling
medium,  and  not impeded  by  a resisting  one.

 AC        , or ofgr^   to             may  be given ; the  body, in an  uni-

form  medium,  whose  resistance  is as the power  V"  of the  velocity  V, will
move  in this curve.  But  let us return  to more  simple  curves.
   Because  there  can  be no  motion  in  a para
bola except  in  a  non-resisting  medium,  but                     z
in the hyperbolas  here  described  it is produced
by  a perpetual  resistance ; it is evident  that
the  line which  a  projectile  describes  in  an
uniformly  resisting medium  approaches  nearer
to  these hyperbolas  than  to  a parabola.  That
line  is certainly  of the  hyperbolic  kind, but
about  the vertex  it is more  distant from  the
asymptotes,  and  in the parts remote  from  the
vertex  draws  nearer  to them  than  these  hy-  M JL    BD  K
perbolas  here described.  The  difference,  however,  is not  so great  between
the  one  and  the other  but  that  these  latter may  be commod^ously  enough
used  in practice  instead  of the former.  And  perhaps  these may  prove  more
useful  than  an hyperbola  that  is more  accurate,  and  at the same  time  more
compounded.  They  may  be made  use  of, then,  in this manner.
   Complete  the parallelogram XYGT,   and  the right  line GT  will  touch
the hyperbola  in G, and  therefore  the density  of  the medium  in G  is  re-

ciprocally  as the tangent GT,  and  the velocity  there  as ^  -^=-  ; and  the
                                           2nn
resistance  is to the  force  of gravity  as GT   to                                                    n +2^-  X  GV.
   Therefore  if a body  projected  from  the               GT2
place A, in the direction  of  the right  line
AH,  describes  the hyperbola AGK   and
AH  produced  meets  the asymptote NX   in
H,  arid AI  drawrri  parallel  to it meets  the
other  asymptote MX   in I ; the density  of
the mediu.n  in A  will  be  reciprocally  as
AH.  and  the  velocity  of  the body  as  -J

  RULE  1.  If the density  of the medium   at A, and  the velocity  with which
the body  is projected  remain  the  same,  and  the  angle NAH   be changed   ,
the lengths AH,  AI, HX   will remain.  Therefore  if those  lengths,  in any

| asymptotes, a | nd in the par | ts rem | ote from | the |  |  |

| the one and t | he other but | that t | hese latt | er may be | commod^ously | enough |
| used in practi | ce instead o | f the f | ormer. A | nd perhaps | these may prov | e more |
| useful than an | hyperbola | that is | more acc | urate, and a | t the same tim | e more |
| compounded. | They may | be mad | e use of, | then, in thi | s manner. |  |
| Complete t | he parallelo | gram X | YGT, a | nd the right | line GT wil | l touch |
| the hyperbola | in G, and t | herefor | e the den | sity of the | medium in G | is re- |

| Therefore i | f a body pro | jected | from the |  | GT2 |  |

 one  case, are  found,  the hyperbola  may  afterwards  be  easily determined
from  any  given  angle NAH.
   RULE  2.  If the angle NAH,  and  the  density  of the medium  at  A, re
main  the  same,  and  the  velocity  with  which  the  body  is projected  be
changed,  the length AH   will continue  the same  ; and AI  will  be changed
in a duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity  reciprocally.
   RULE  3.  If the angle NAH,  the velocity  of the body  at A, and  the  ac-
celerative  gravity  remain  the same,  and  the proportion  of the  resistance  at
A  to the motive  gravity  be augmented  in any  ratio ; the proportion  of AH
 to A I will  be augmented  in the same  ratio, the  latus rectum  of  the above-

mentioned  parabola  remaining  the same,  and  also  the lengthAI   propor-
tional  to  it ; and  therefore AH   will  be diminished  in  the same  ratio, and
AI  will  be diminished  in the duplicate  of that ratio.  But  the  proportion
of the resistance  to the weight  is augmented,  when  either  the  specificAH2 grav
ity is made  less, the magnitude  remaining  equal,  or when  the  density  of
the medium   is made  greater,  or  when,  by diminishing  the magnitude,  the
resistance  becomes  diminished  in a less ratio than  the weight.
  RULE  4. Because  the density  of the medium   is greater  near  the  vertex
of the hyperbola  than  it is in  the  place  A, that  a mean  density may  be
preserved,  the  ratio  of the least  of the  tangents GT   to the  tangent AH
ought  to be found, and  the  density  in A  augmented  in  a  ratio  a  little
greater  than  that  of half the sum  of  those  tangents  to  the  least  of  the
tangents GT.
  RULE  5.  If the lengths AH,  AI  are  given, and  the  figure AGK   is to be
described,  produce HN   to X,  so that HX  may  be  to AI  as n  -\- 1 to 1 ; and
with  the  centre  X, and  the asymptotes  MX,  NX,  describe  an  hyperbola
through  the point A, such  that AI may  be  to any  of the  lines VG  as XV"
to xr.
  RULE  6. By  how  much  the greater  the number  n  is, so much  the  more
accurate  are  these hyperbolas  in the ascent  of the body from  A, and  less
accurate  in  its descent  to K  ; and  the contrary.  The  conic  hyperbola
keeps  a mean  ratio between  these, and  is more  simple  than  the rest.  There
fore  if the hyperbola  be  of this  kind, and  you  are  to  find  the point K,
where  the projected  body  falls upon  any  right  line AN  passing  through
the point  A, let AN  produced  meet  the asymptotes MX,  NX   in M  and N,
and  take NK  equal  to AM.
  RULE  7. And  hence  appears  an  expeditious  method  of determining  this
hyperbola  from  the phenomena.  Let  two  similar  and  equal  bodies  be pro
jected with  the same  velocity,  in different  angles HAK,  h A k, and  let them
fall upon  the plane  of  the horizon  in K  and  k ; and  note  the  proportion
of AK   to A A".  Let  it be  as d  to e.  Then  erecting  a perpendicular  A I of
uny length, assume  any how  the length AH   or Ah, and  thence  graphically,

| celerative gra | vity rem | ain the s | ame, | and th | e proportion | of the | resistance at |

| AI will be di | minished | in the d | uplica | te of | that ratio. | But the | proportion |
| of the resista | nce to t | he weight | is au | gmente | d, when eit | her the | speAciHf2ic grav |
| ity is made le | ss, the | magnitude | rem | aining | equal, or | when th | e density of |
| the medium i | s made | greater, or | when | , by | diminishing | the mag | nitude, the |
| resistance bec | omes di | minished i | n a l | ess rat | io than the | weight. |  |
| RULE 4. B | ecause t | he density | of t | he med | ium is grea | ter near | the vertex |
| of the hyperbo | la than | it is in | the | place | A, that a m | ean den | sity may be |
| preserved, the | ratio o | f the least | of | the ta | ngents GT | to the | tangent AH |
| ought to be f | ound, an | d the den | sity | in A | augmented | in a r | atio a little |
| greater than | that of | half the s | um o | f thos | e tangents | to the | least of the |
| tangents GT. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| RULE 5. If | the len | gths AH, | AI ar | e give | n, and the | figure A | GK is to be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| described, pro | duce HN | to X, so | that | HX | may be to A | I as n -\ | - 1 to 1 ; a nd |
| with the cent | re X, a | nd the as | ympto | tes M | X, NX, de | scribe a | n hyperbola |

| to xr. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| RULE 6. B | y how m | uch the g | reater | the | number n is | , s o muc | h the more |
| accurate are t | hese hyp | erbolas in | the | ascent | of the bod | y from | A, and less |
| accurate in i | ts desce | nt to K ; | and | the c | ontrary. T | he coni | c hyperbola |

or by scale and  compass,  collect  the lengths AK,  A/>* (by Rule   6).   If the
ratio  of AK   to  A/.* bo the same  with  that  of d  to  e, the length  of AH  was





rightly assumed.   If not, take  on  the indefinite  right  line SM,  the  length
SM  equal  to the assumed AH  ; and  erect  a perpendicular MN  equal  to the
          AK     d
difference  -r-r        of the  ratios drawn  into any  given  right  line.   By  the

like method,  from  several  assumed  lengths AH,  you may  find several  points
N  ; and  draw  througli them  all a regular  curve NNXN,   cutting  tr.e right
line SMMM   in X.   Lastly, assume AH  equal  to  the  abscissa  SX,  and

thence  find again  the length AK  ; and  the  lengths,  w'hich  are  to  the  as
sumed  length  AI, and  this  last AH,  as the  length AK  known  by experi
ment,  to the length AK   last found,  will  be the true  lengths  AI  and  AH,
which  were  to be found.  But  these  being  given,  there  will be given  also
the  resisting  force  of the medium   in the  place A, it being  to  the  force  of
gravity  as AH   to JAI.  Let  the density  of the medium  be  increased  by
Rule  4, and  if the resisting  force  just found  be increased  in the same  ratio,
it will become  still more  accurate.
  RULE  8. The  lengths AH, HX   being  found  ; let there  be now   re
quired  the position  of the  line AH,  according  to which  a projectile thrown
with  that given  velocity  shall  fall upon  any  point K.  At  the  joints A
and  K,  erect  the  lines AC, KF  perpendicular  to the  horizon  : whereof  let
AC  be drawn  downwards,  and  be equal  to AI  or ^HX.  With  the asymp
totes AK,  KF,  describe  an hyperbola,  whose  conjugate  shall  pass through
the point C  ; and from  the  centre  A, with  the  interval AH.  describe  a cir
cle cutting  that hyperbola  in the point H ; then  the  projectile thrown  in
the direction  of the right  line AH   will  fall upon  the point K.  Q.E.I.  For
the point H, because  of  the given  length AH,  must  be somewhere  in  the
circumference  of the described  circle.  Draw  CH  meeting AK  and KF   in
E  and F:  and  because CH, MX   are  parallel, and  AC,  AI  equal, AE  will
be equal  to AM,  and  therefore  also equal  to KN.  But  CE   is to AE   as
FH   to KN.  and  therefore CE  and FH   are equal.  Therefore  the point H
falls upon  the hyperbolic  curve  described  with  the asymptotes AK,.KF
whose  conjugate  passes through  the point C  ; and  is therefore  found  in the

                                 served  that  this  operation  is the  same,
                                 whether  the right  line AKN   be parallel  to

the density  of the medium  at A, and  the  velocity with  which  the body  is
projected, remaining  the  same,  the  angle NAH   be any how  altered,  the

through  which  the projectile  will  pass.

If a body  be resisted partly  in the  ratio and  partly  in  the duplicate  ratio
   of its velocity, and  moves  in  a similar  medium  by  its  innate  force
  only;  and  the  times  be taken  in arithmetical  progression;  then
   quantities  reciprocally  proportional  to the velocities, increased  by a  cer

AB,  DE,  de. be parallel  to the asymptote  CH.    In |

   For  let the  areola  DEec/  be the  least given  increment  of  the  time, and
 Dd  will be reciprocally  as DE,  and  therefore  directly  as  CD.    Therefore

          PROPOSITION    XII.  THEOREM   IX.

 The  same  things  being  supposed,  I say,  that  if the spaces  described  are
   taken  in arithmetical  progression,  the  velocities augmented  by a  cer
   tain given  quantity  will  be in geometrical  progression.
                                   In the asymptote CD   let there  be given  the
                                point R, and, erecting  the  perpendicular RS
                             meeting  the hyperbola  in S, let  the space  de
                                  scribed  be expounded  by the  hyperbolic  area
                                        I RSED   ; and  the velocity  will  be as the length
                                         J GD,  which,  together  with  the given  line CG,

                              ** composes  a length CD  decreasing  in  a  geo
metrical  progression,  while  the space RSED   increases  in an  arithmetical
[(regression.
   For, because  the  incre  nent EDde  of the  space  is given,  the  lineola  DC?,
which  is the decrement  of GD,  will be  reciprocally  as ED,  and  therefore
directly  as CD  ; that  is, as the sum  of the same GD  and  the given  length
CG.   But  the decrement  of the  velocity,  in  a time  reciprocally  propor
tional  thereto,  in which  the given  particle  of space D^/eE  is described,  is
as the resistance  and  the  time  conjunctly,  that  is. directly  as the sum  of
two  quantities,  whereof  one  is as the velocity,  the  other  as  the square  of
the velocity,  and  inversely  as the  veh  city ; and  therefore  directly  as  the
sum  of two  quantities,  one  of which  is given,  the other  is- as the  velocity.
Therefore  the decrement  both  of the velocity  and  the  line GD   is as  a given
quantity  and  a decreasing  quantity  conjunctly;  and, because  the  decre
ments  are analogous,  the decreasing  quantities  will always  be analogous ;

           PROPOSITION   XKI.   THEOREM   X.

 Supposing  that  a body  attracted downwards  by an  uniform  gravity  as
   cends  or descends  in  a  right  line; and  that  the same  is  resisted
   partly  in the ratio  of its  velocity, and  partly  in  the  duplicate  ratio
   thereof:  I say,  that, if right  lines parallel  to the diameters  of a circle
   and  an  hyperbola,  be drawn  through  the ends  of the, conjugate  diame
    ters, and  the  velocities  be as some  segments  of those  parallels  drawn
   from  a given  point,  the times  will  be as  the  sectors  of  the, areas  cut
   off by right  lines drawn  from  the centre  to the ends  of  the segments  ;
   and  the contrary.
   CASE  1. Suppose  first that  the  body  is ascending,
and  from  the centre  D, with  any  semi-diameter  DB,
describe  a quadrant BETF   of  a circle, and  through
the end B  of the semi-diameter  DB  draw  the  indefi
nite  line BAP,  parallel  to the semi-diameter  DF.    In
chat  line  let there  be given  the point  A, and  take  the
segment  AP  proportional  to the  velocity.    And  since
one  part  of the  resistance  is as  the  velocity,  and
another  part  as  the  square  of the  velocity,  let  the
whole  resistance  be  as AP2   -f 2BAP.     Join  DA,  DP,  cutting  the  circle
in E  and  T, and  let the gravity  be expounded  by DA2,  so that  the gravity
shall  be  to  the resistance  in P  as DA2  to AP2+2BAP   ; and  the time  of the
whole  ascent  will  be  as the  sector EDT   of the  circle.
   For  draw  DVQ,,  cutting  off the moment  PQ,  of the  velocity AP,  and  the
moment  DTV   of the sector DET  answering  to  a given moment  of  time  ;
and  that decrement  PQ,  of the velocity  will  be  as the sum  of  the  forces  of
gravity DA2  and  of resistance AP2  +  2BAP,  that  is (by Prop.  XII
BookII,Elem.),asDP*.  Then  the arsa DPQ,  which  is proportional  to PQ:
is as DP2,  and  the  area DTV,  which  is to the area DPQ,  as DT2   to DP2,  it
as the given  quantity DT2.   Therefore  the area EDT   decreases  uniformly
according  to the rate  of the future  time, by subduction  of given  particles DT  V,
and  is therefore  proportional  to the time  of  the whole  ascent.  Q..E.D.
  CASE  2.  If the velocity  in the  ascent
of the body  be expounded  by the  length
AP  as before, and  the  resistance  be made
as AP2   -f- 2BAP,and   if the force  of grav
ity be  less than  can  be expressed  by DA2  ;
take BD  of such  a length,  that AB2  —
BD2  maybe  proportional  to the gravity,
and  let DF  be perpendicular  and  equal                F O

to DB,  and through  the vertex  F  describe  the hyperbola FTVE,  whose  con
jugate  semi -diameters  are DB  and DF;  and  which  cuts DA   in E, and DP,
DQ   in T  and V ; and  the time  of  the whole  ascent  will be  as  the hyper
bolic  sector TDE.
  For  the decrement  PQ   of the velocity, produced  in  a given  particle  of
time,  is as  the sum  of the  resistance AP2   -f 2BAP  and  of  the gravity
AB2  —  BD2,  that  is, as BP2  — BD2.   But  the  area DTV   is to the area
DPQ   as DT2   to DP2  ; and, therefore,  if GT  be drawn  perpendicular  to
DF.  as GT2   or GD2  —  DF2   to BD2,  and  as GD2  to BP2,  and, by di
vision,  as DF2   to BP2  — BD2.   Therefore  since  the area DPQ   is as PQ,
that  is, as BP2  —  BD2,  the  area DTV   will  be  as the given quantity DF2.
Therefore  the  area EDT   decreases  uniformly  in each  of the  equal  particles
of time, by the subduction  of so many  given  particles DTV,  and  therefore
is proportional  to the time.  Q.E.D.
                      CASE  3. Let AP  be  the  velocity  in the  descent  of

                       """   the body, and AP2  + 2BAP    the  force  of  resistance,
                       and BD2  —  AB2  the force  of gravity,  the angle DBA
                      being  a right  one.   And  if with  the centre  D, and  the
                      principal  vertex  B, there  be  described   a  rectangular
                     hyperbola BETV   cutting DA,  DP,  and DQ  produced
                         in E, T, and  V  : the  sector DET   of this hyperbola  will
D                be as the whole  time  of descent.
   For  the increment PQ   of the  velocity, and  the area DPQ   proportional
to  it, is  as  the  excess  of  the  gravity  above  the  resistance,  that  is, as

m)2?_  AB2 _2BAP  —  AP2    or BD2—  BP2.    And  the  area DTV
is to the  area DPQ   as DT3   to DP2  ; and  therefore  as GT2   or GD"   -
BD2   to BP2,  and  as GD2   to BD2,  and, by division,  as BD2   to BD2   -
 BP2.    Therefore  since  the ami DPQ   is as BD2  —  BP2,  the area DTV
 will be  as the given  quantity  BD2.    Therefore  the  area EDT   increases
uniformly  in  the  several  equal  particles  of time  by  the  addition   of  as
many  given  particles DTV,  and  therefore  is proportional   to  the time  of
 the  descent.    Q.E.D.
   Con.  If with  the centre D  and  the semi-diameter DA  there  be drawn
 through  the vertex A  an  arc A/  similar  to the arc ET,  and  similarly  sub-
 tendino^the  angle  A DT,  the velocity AP  will be to the velocity  which  the
body  in the time EDT,  in  a non-resisting  space, can  lose in  its ascent,  or
acquire  in its descent,  as the  area  of the triangle DAP   to the  area  of the
Bector DA/  ; and  therefore  is given from  the time given.  For  the velocity
ir a non-resistin^ medium   is proportional  to the  time, and  therefore  to this
 sector : in a resisting medium,  it is as the triangle ; and  in both mediums,
 where  it is least, it approaches  to the ratio  of equality,  as the  sector  and

 The  same  things  being  supposed,  1 say,  that  the space  described  in  the

   expressed,  and  of some  other  area  which  is augmented   or diminished
    in an  arithmetical  progression  ; if the forces compounded  of the  re

 to the resistance ; but  take them  on  the same  side  of the  point  A, if the

of the  area A6NK   above  the  area DET.

   The  resistance  of spherical  bodies  in fluids  arises  partly from  the  tena
city, partly from  the  attrition,  and  partly from  the density  of the medium.
And  that  part  of the  resistance  which  arises from  the density  of  the  fluid
is, as I said, in a duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity ; the  other  part, which
arises from  the tenacity  of the  fluid,  is uniform,  or  as  the moment  of  the
time  ; and,  therefore,  we  might  now  proceed  to the motion  of bodies,  whicli
are  resisted  partly by an uniform  force,  or in the  ratio  of the moments  of
the  time,  and  partly  in the duplicate  ratio  of the velocity.  But  it is suf
ficient  to have  cleared  the way  to this speculation  in Prop. VIII  and  IX
foregoing,  and  their Corollaries.  For  in those  Propositions,  instead  of the
uniform  resistance made  to  an  ascending  body  arising from  its gravity,
one may  substitute  the uniform  resistance  which  arises from  the  tenacity
of the medium,  when  the body moves  by  its vis insita  alone  ; and when  the
body  ascends  in  a right  line, add  this uniform  resistance  to the  force  of
gravity, and  subduct  it when  the  body  descends  in  a  right  line.  One
might  also go  on  to the motion  of bodies  which  are  resisted  in part  uni
formly,  in part in the  ratio  of the  velocity, and  in part  in  the  duplicate
ratio  of  the same  velocity.  And  I have  opened  a way  to  this  in Prop.
XIII  and XIV  foregoing,  in which  the uniform  resistance  arising from  the
tenacity  of the medium  may  be substituted  for the  force  of gravity,  or be
compounded  with  it as before.  But  I hasten  to other  things.

Let PQR   be a  spiral  rutting  all the  radii  SP, SO,  SR,  <J*c., in equal

   P  a/*(/ Q  approach  and  coincide,  the angle PSO   vri/Z become  a  right
   angle, and  the ultimate  ratio  of the rectangle  TQ,  X 2PS  to P^3    //>i//

   For  from  the right angles OPQ,  OQR,  sub
duct  the equal angles SPQ,  SQR,  and  there
will  remain  the  equal  angles   OPS,  OQS.
Therefore  a circle which  passes through  the
points OSP   will pass  also through  the  point
Q.    Let  the  points P  and  Q,  coincide,  and
this  circle  will touch  the  spiral  in  the  place
of coincidence  PQ,  and  will  therefore  cut  the
right  line OP  perpendicularly.    Therefore  OP  will become  a diameter  of
this  circle, and  the  angle OSP,  being  in  a  semi-circle,  becomes   a  right
one.    Q.E.1).
  Draw  Q,D, SE  perpendicular  to OP,  and  the ultimate  ratios  of the lines
will be as follows  : TO   to PD  as TS  or PS  to PE,  or 2PO   to 2PS   • and
PD  to PO  as PO   to 2PO  ; and,  ex  cequo  pertorbatt,  to TO   to PO  as PO

arc PQ   is the fourth  part  of the decrement  of  the arc PR.  Whence   also
if the area QSr  be taken  equal  to the  area PSQ,  the decrement  of the  arc
PQ  will be equal  to half  the  lineola  Rr  ; and  therefore  the  force  of resist
ance  and  the centripetal  force  are  to each  other  as the lineola jRrandTQ
which  they generate  in the same  time.  Because  the centripetal  force with
which  the  body  is urged  in P  is reciprocally  as SP2,  and  (by Lem.  X,
Book  I) the lineola TQ,  which  is generated  by that  force, is in  a  ratio
compounded  of the  ratio  of this force and  the duplicate  ratio  of the  time
in which  the  arc PQ,  is described  (for in  this case  I neglect  the  resistance,
as being  infinitely  less than  the centripetal  force), it follows  that TQ  X

SP2,  that  is (by the  last Lemma),  fPQ2  X  SP,  will  be in a duplicate  ra
tio of the  time, and  therefore  the time  is as PQ, X  v/SP  ; and  the  velo
city of the body, with  which  the  arc PQ   is described  in  that  time,  as
 PQ       1
       — -«p or     , that  is, in the subduplicate  ratio  of SP  reciprocally.
And,  by a like reasoning,  the velocity  with  which  the  arc QR   is described,
is in the subduplicate  ratio  of SQ  reciprocally.  Now  those  arcs PQ  and
QR   are  as the describing  velocities  to each  other  ; that  is, in  the subdu
plicate  ratio  of SQ  to SP,  or  as SQ  to x/SP  X SQ;  and, because  of  the
equal  angles SPQ,  SQ?', and  the equal  areas PSQ,  QSr,  the  arc PQ   is to
the arc Qr  as SQ  to SP.  Take  the differences  of the proportional  conse

quents,  and  the arc PQ  will be  to the  arc Rr  as SQ  to SP —  VSP  X ~SQ~,
or ^VQ.  For  the points P and Q  coinciding,  the ultimate  ratio  of SP —
      X SQ  to |VQ   is the  ratio  of  equality.    Because  the decrement  of
the  arc PQ  arising from  the  resistance,  or its double  Rr,  is as the resistance

and  the square  of  the time  conjunctly,  the resistance  will be &Sp-^r  *1 —X  op.

But PQ  was  to Rr  as SQ  to |VQ,  and  thence   JrSSaTXToDvst   X  oJr  becomes  as
 -VQ        -OS
pWxsvxSQ,'   or ns ETp^TsP-     For the poillts p and a coincidin&
SP  and SQ  coincide  also, and  the angle PVQ  becomes  a right  one;  and,
because  of the similar  triangles PVQ,  PSO,  PQ. becomes  to  '-VQ  as OP                      OS
to | OS.    Therefore    \J: i y —X  ol—  -- is as the  resistance,  that  is, in the  ratio  of
the density  of the medium  in P  and  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity
conjunc-tly.    Subduct  the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity, namely,  the  ratio
1                                      OS
OA^5,  and  there  will remain  the density  of the medium  in  P.  as  7^5Ur -X   fei=
Let  the spiral be given,  and; because  of the given  ratio  of OS  to OP,  the

 density  of the medium  in P  will  be  as  ~-p.   Therefore  in  a medium  whose

   COR.  1. The  velocity  in any  place P, is always  the  same  wherewith   a
body  in  a non-resisting medium  with  the same  centripetal  force would  re
volve  in  a circle, at the same  distance  SP  from  the  centre.
   COR.  2. The  density  of  the medium,  if the  distance  SP  be given,  is as

TTp, but  if that  distance  is not  given,  as ^      ^5.   And   thence  a  spiral
may  be  fitted  to any  density  of the medium.
   COR.  3. The  force  of the resistance  in any  place P  is to the  centripetal
force  in the same  place as |OS  to OP.  For  those  forces  are  to each  other
                    ^VQ  x  PQ      iPQ2
as iRr  and TQ,  or as 1—^-^~-ol%,and ^-,ol     that  is, as iVQ  and  PQ,
or |OS  and OP.  The  spiral therefore  being  given,  there  is given  the pro
portion  of the resistance  to the centripetal  force  ; and, vice  versa, from  that
proportion  given  the  spiral  is given.
   COR.  4. Therefore  the body  cannot  revolve  in this  spiral, except  where
the  force  of resistance  is less than  half  the centripetal  force.  Let  the  re
sistance  be made  equal  to half  the centripetal  force, and  the spiral  will  co
incide  with  the right  line PS, and  in that  right  line  the body  will descend
 to the  centre with  a  velocity  that  is to the  velocity, with  which  it was
 proved  before,  in the  case  of the  parabola  (Theor.  X, Book  I), the  descent
 would  be made  in  a  non-resisting  medium,  in  the  subduplicate  ratio  of
 unity  to the number  two.  And  the times  of the descent  will be here  recip
 rocally  as the  velocities,  and  therefore  given.
   COR.  5. And  because  at  equal  distances
 from  the  centre  the velocity  is the same  in the
 spiral PQ,R  as  it is in the right  line SP, and
 the length  of the spiral  is to the length  of the
 right  line PS  in  a given  ratio, namely,  in the
 ratio  of OP  to OS  ; the time  of the descent  in
 the  spiral  will be  to the time  of the descent  in
 the right  line SP  in the same  given  ratio, and
 therefore  given.
   COR.  6.  If from  the centre  S, with  any two
 given  intervals,  two  circles  are described  ; and
 these  circles remaining,  the angle which  the  spiral makes  with  the  radius"
 PS  be any how  changed ; the number  of revolutions  which  the  body  can
 complete  in the space  between  the  circumferences  of those  circles,PS going
 round  in the spiral from  one  circumference  to another,  will be  as 7^,  or  as

 ths tangent  of the angle which  the spiral makes  with  the radius  PS  ; and                                       19

   COR.  9. And  although  these  motions  becoming  eccentrical  should  be
 performed  in  spirals approaching  to  an  oval  figure,  yet, conceiving  the
 several  revolutions  of those  spirals  to be at the same  distances  from  each
 other, and  to approach  to the centre  by  the same  degrees  as the spiral above
 described,  we may  also understand  how  the motions  of bodies may  be  per
 formed  in spirals  of that  kind.

          PROPOSITION   XVI.   THEOREM   XIII.

 If the density  of the medium   in each  of  the places  be reciprocally  as  the
   distance  of  the  >, places from  the immoveable  centre, and  the  centripetal
   force  be reciprocally  as any  power  of the same  distance,  I say,  that  the
   body may  revolve  in  a spiral intersecting  all  the  radii  drawn  from
   that  centre  in  a  given, angle.
   This  is demonstrated  in  the same  manner   as
 the foregoing  Proposition.    For  if the  centri
 petal  force  in P be  reciprocally  as  any  power
SPn+1   of the distance SP  whose  index  is n
 +  1 ; it will  be  collected,  as  above,  that  the
 time  in which  the body  describes  any  arc PQ,
                              i
will  be as PQ, X  PS2U  ; and  the  resistance  in

   This  Proposition  and  the former,  which  relate  to mediums  of unequal
density,  are  to be understood  of the motion  of bodies  that  are  so small,  that
the greater  density  of the medium  on  one  side of  the body  above  that  on
the other  is not  to be considered.  I suppose  also  the  resistance,  cateris

                     SECTION   V.

     Of  the density  and  compression  of fluids  ; and  of hydrostatics.

                              THE   DEFINITION      OF    A  FLUID.

 A  fluid  is any  body  whose  parts  yield  to any force impressed  on  it,
             by yielding,  are  easily moved  among  themselves.

          PROPOSITION   XIX.   THEOREM   XIv

 All  the parts  of a homogeneous  and  unmoved  fluid  included  in any  un
   moved  vessel, and  compressed  on  every  side  (setting  aside  the consider
   ation  of condensation,   gravity,   and   all centripetal  forces],  will  be
   equally  pressed  on  every  side, and  remain  in their places  without  any
   motion  arising from  that pressure.
   CASE  1. Let  a fluid  be included  in the spherical
 vessel  ABC,  and  uniformly  compressed  on  every
 side : 1 say, that  no  part of  it will be moved  by
 that  pressure.    For  if any  part, as  L), be moved,
 all such  parts  at  the same  distance  from  the centre
 on  every  side must  necessarily  be  moved    at  the
same  time  by a like motion  ; because  the  pressure
 of them  all  is similar  and  equal ; and  all other
motion  is excluded  that  does  not  arise from  that

pressure.    But  if these  parts  come  all of them  nearer  to the  centre,  the
fluid  must  be condensed  towards  the  centre, contrary  to  the supposition.
If they  recede  from  it, the  fluid must  be condensed  towards  the  circumfer
ence  ; which  is also contrary  to the  supposition.    Neither   can  they move
 in any  one  direction  retaining  their  distance  from  the centre,  because  for
the same  reason,  they may  move  in  a contrary  direction  : but  the  sami
part  cannot  be  moved   contrary  ways  at  the  same   time.    Therefore  no
part  of the  fluid  will  be moved  from  its place.    Q,.E.T).
   CASE  2.  I say now,  that  all the spherical  parts  of  this  fluid  are  equally
pressed  on  every  side.  For  let EF  be  a spherical  part  of the  fluid ; if this
be not  pressed  equally  on  every  side, augment  the  lesser  pressure  till  it be
pressed  equally  on  every  side; and  its parts  (by Case  I) will remain  in
their places.  But  before  the  increase  of the  pressure,  they would  remain
in their  places (by Case  1) ; and  by the addition  of  a new  pressure  they
will be moved,  by the  definition  of a fluid, from  those  places.  Now  these
two  conclusions  contradict  each other.  Therefore  it was  false  to say  that
the sphere EF  was  not  pressed  equally  on  every  side.  Q,.E.D.
  CASE  3.  I say besides,  that  different  spherical  parts have  equal  pressures.
For  the contiguous  spherical  parts  press  each  other  mutually  and  equally
in  the point  of contact  (by Law  III).  But  (by Case  2) they are  pressed  on
every  side with  the same  force.  Therefore  any two  spherical  parts  lot

| motio | n arisi | ng from that | pressure. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| CASE | 1. Let | a fluid be inc | luded in th | e spherical |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| vessel | ABC, a | nd uniformly | compressed | on every |  |  |
| side : 1 | say, tha | t no part of i | t will be | moved by |  |  |
| that pre | ssure. | For if any p | art, as L), | be moved, |  |  |
| all such | parts a | t the same dis | tance from | the centre |  |  |
| on ever | y side | must necessari | ly be mov | ed at the |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| same ti | me by a | like motion ; | b ecause t | he pressure |  |  |
| of them | all is | similar and e | qual ; and | all other |  |  |
| motion | is exclu | ded that does | not arise | from that |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| pressure. | But | if these parts | come all | of them neare | r to the | centre, the |
| fluid m | ust be | condensed tow | ards the | centre, contrary | to the | supposition. |
| If they | recede f | rom it, the flu | id must be | condensed towa | rds the | circumfer |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ence ; w | hich is | also contrary | to the supp | osition. Neit | her can | they move |
| in any | one dire | ction retainin | g their dis | tance from the | centre, | because for |
| the sam | e reason | , they may m | ove in a | contrary directi | on : but | the sami |
| part ca | nnot be | moved contr | ary ways | at the same t | ime. Th | erefore no |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| part of | the fluid | will be moved | from its | place. Q,.E.T). |  |  |
| CASE | 2. I sa | y now, that al | l the spher | ical parts of th | is fluid | are equally |
| pressed | on every | side. For le | t EF be a | spherical part | of the fl | uid ; i f this |
| be not p | ressed e | qually on ever | y side, au | gment the lesser | pressur | e till it be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| pressed | equally | on every side | ; and its | parts (by Case | I) will | remain in |
| their pl | aces. B | ut before the | increase of | the pressure, | they wou | ld remain |
| in their | places ( | by Case 1) ; a | nd by the | addition of a | new pr | essure they |
| will be | moved, | by the definiti | on of a flui | d, from those | places. | Now these |
| two con | clusions | contradict eac | h other. | Therefore it wa | s false | to say that |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the sphe | re EF | was not pressed | equally o | n every side. | Q,.E.D. |  |

 contiguous,  since  an intermediate  spherical  part  can  touch  both,  will  be
 pressed  with  the same  force.  Q.E.D.
   CASE  4.  I say now,  that  all the  parts  of the  fluid  are  every  where  press
 ed equally.  For  any  two  parts may  be touched  by spherical  parts  in any
points whatever  ; and  there  they  will  equally  .press those  spherical  parts
(by Case  3). and  are  reciprocally  equally  pressed  by them  (by Law   III).
Q.E.D.
   CASE  5. Since,  therefore,  any  part GHI   of  the  fluid  is inclosed  by the
rest  of the  fluid  as in  a vessel, and  is equally  pressed  on  every  side  ; and
also  its parts equally  press  one  another,  and  are  at  rest among  themselves  ;
it is manifest  that  all the  parts  of any  fluid  as GHI,  which  is pressed
equally  on  every  side, do  press  each  other  mutually  and  equally,  and  are  at
rest among  themselves.  Q.E.D.
   CASE  6. Therefore  if that  fluid  be included  in  a  vessel  of a  yielding
substance,  or that  is not  rigid, and  be  not  equally  pressed  on  every  side,
the same  will give way  to  a stronger  pressure, by the  Definition  of fluidity.
   CASE  7. And  therefore,  in an  inflexible  or rigid  vessel, a fluid  will  not
Sustain  a stronger  pressure  on  one  side  than  on  the  other, but  will  give
way  to  it, and  that  in  a moment  of  time ; because  the  rigid  side  of  the
vessel  does  not follow  the yielding  liquor.  But  the  fluid, by thus  yielding,
will  press  against  the opposite  side, and  so the pressure  will  tend  on  every
side  to equality.  And  because  the  fluid,  as soon  as  it endeavours  to recede
from  the part  that  is most  pressed,  is withstood  by the  resistance  of  the
vessel  on  the opposite  side, the  pressure  will  on  every  side  be reduced  to
equality,  in  a moment   of time, without  any  local motion   : and  from  thence
the parts  of the  fluid  (by Case  5) will  press  each  other mutually  and  equal
ly, and  be  at rest among  themselves.  Q..E.D.
   COR.  Whence  neither  will  a motion  of  the parts  of  the  fluid among
themselves  be changed  by  a pressure communicated  to  the external  super
ficies, except  so far  as  either  the  figure  of the superficies may  be somewhere
altered,  or that  all the parts  of the  fluid, by pressing  one  another  more  in
tensely  or remissly, may  slide with  more  or  less  difficulty among  them
selves.

          PROPOSITION   XX.   THEOREM   XV.

Jf all  the parts  of a spherical  fluid, homogeneous  at equal  distances from
   the  centre, lying  on. a  spherical  concentric  bottom,  gravitate  towards
   the  centre  of the whole,  the bottom  will sustain  the weight  of a  cylin

   Let OHM   be  the  superficies  of the bottom,  and AEI  the upper  super

conceive  the  force  of gravity  to act only  in the
upper  superficies  of every  orb, and  the actions
to be equal  on  the equal parts  of  all the  su
perficies.  Therefore  the upper  superficies AE
is pressed by the  single  force  of its own  grav
ity, by which  all the parts  of  the upper  orb,
and  the  second  superficies BFK,  will  (by
Prop.  XIX),  according  to  its measure,  be
equally pressed.  The  second  superficies BFK
is pressed  likewise  by  the  force  of  its own
gravity,  which,  added  to the  former  force,
makes  the pressure double.  The  third  superficies CGL   is, according  to its
measure,  acted  on by this pressure  and  the  force  of its own  gravity  besides,
which  makes  its pressure  triple.  And  in like manner  the  fourth  superfi
cies receives  a quadruple  pressure,  the  fifth superficies  a  quintuple,  and  so
on.  Therefore  the pressure  acting  on  every  superficies  is not  as  the  solid
quantity  of  the incumbent  fluid, but  as the number  of  the  orbs  reaching
 to the upper  surface  of the  fluid  ; and  is equal  to the gravity  of the lowest
 orb multiplied  by the number  of  orbs : that  is, to  the  gravity  of  a solid
 whose  ultimate  ratio  to the cylinder above-mentioned  (when  the number  of
 the  orbs  is increased  and  their  thickness  diminished,  ad  infiititum,  so that
 the action  of gravity  from  the lowest  superficies  to the uppermost  may  be-
 some  continued)  is the  ratio  of equality.  Therefore  the lowest  superficies
 •sustains  the weight  of the cylinder  above determined.  Q..E.D.  And  by a
 like reasoning  the Proposition  will  be  evident, where  the  gravity  of  the
 fluid decreases  in any  assigned  ratio  of the distance  from  the  centre,  and
 also where  the  fluid  is more  rare  above  and  denser below.  Q.E.D.

   COR.  1. Therefore  the bottom  is not  pressed by the whole  weight  of the
 incumbent  fluid, but  only  sustains  that  part  of  it which  is described  in the
 Proposition  ; the  rest  of the weight  being sustained  archwise  by the spheri

   Con.  4. And  therefore  if another  body  of  the same  specific  gravity,  in
capable  of condensation,  be immersed  in this  fluid,  it will  acquire  no  mo
tion by the pressure  of the incumbent  weight:  it will  neither  descend  nor           .
ascend,  nor change  its figure.  If it be spherical,  it will remain  so, notwith
standing  the pressure  ; if it be  square,  it will remain  square;  and  that,
whether  it be soft or fluid  : whether  it swims  freely  in the  fluid, or lies at
the bottom.  For  any  internal  part  of a fluid  is in the same  state  with  the
submersed  body  ; and  the  case  of all submersed  bodies  that have  the  same
magnitude,  figure, and  specific gravity,  is alike.  If a submersed  body,  re
taining  its weight,  should  dissolve and  put  on  the form  of a  fluid, this
body,  if before  it would  have  ascended,  descended,  or from  any  pressure  as
sume  a new  figure, would  now  likewise  ascend,  descend,  or put  on  a new
figure  ; and  that, because  its gravity and  the  other  causes  of  its motion
remain.  But  (by Case  5, Prop. XIX;   it would  now  be  at  rest, and  retain
its figure.  Therefore  also in the former  case.
   COR.  5. Therefore  a body  that  is specifically  heavier  than  a  fluid  con
tiguous  to it will sink  ; and  that which  is specifically  lighter  will  ascend,
and  attain  so much  motion  and  change  of figure  as that  excess  or defect  of
gravity  is able  to produce.  For  that  excess  or defect  is the same  thing  as an
impulse,  by which  a body, otherwise  in  equilibria  with  the  parts  of  the
 fluid,  is acted  on:  and may  be compared  with  the  excess  or  defect  of  a
 weight  in one  of the scales  of a balance.

   COR.  6. Therefore  bodies  placed  in fluids have  a twofold  gravity  • the
 one  true  and  absolute,  the other  apparent,  vulgar, and  comparative.  Ab
 solute  gravity  is the whole  force with  which  the body  tends downwards  ;
 relative  and  vulgar  gravity  is the  excess  of gravity  with  which  the body
 tends downwards  more  than  the ambient  fluid.  By  the  first kind  of grav
 ity the parts  of all fluids and  bodies  gravitate  in  their proper  places ; and
 therefore  their weights  taken  together compose  the weight  of  the whole.
 For  the whole  taken  together  is heavy,  as may  be  experienced  in  vessels
 full  of liquor  ; and  the weight  of the whole  is equal  to the weights  of  all
 the  parts, and  is therefore  composed  of them.  By  the  other  kind  of grav
 ity bodies  do  not gravitate  in  their  places ; that  is, compared  with  one

 another,  they  do  not  preponderate,  but, hindering  one  another's  endeavours
 to descend,  remain  in their  proper  places,  as if they were  not heavy.  Those
 things which  are  in the  air, and  do  not  preponderate,  are commonly  looked
 on  as not heavy.  Those  which  do preponderate  are  commonly  reckoned
 heavy,  in  as much  as they  are  not  sustained  by the weight  of the air. The
 Common  weights  are nothing  else but  the  excess  of  the  true  weights  above
 the weight  of the air.  Hence  also, vulgarly,  those  things  are  called  light
 which  are less heavy,  and, by yielding  to  the preponderating  air, mount
 upwards.  But  these  are  only comparatively  lig  s &mA  not  truly  so, because
  hey descend  in  racuo.    Thus,  in water,  bodies  *>icfc. by their  greater  or

| whether it be so | ft or fluid : | whether it sw | ims freely | in the fluid, | or lies at |

| submersed body | ; and the c | ase of all subm | ersed bodie | s that have | the same |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| magnitude, figur | e, and speci | fic gravity, is | alike. If | a submersed | body, re |

| body, if before i | t would hav | e ascended, de | scended, or | from any p | ressure as |

| figure ; and that | , because i | ts gravity and | the other | causes of i | ts motion |
| remain. But ( | by Case 5, | Prop. XIX; it | would now | be at rest, | and retain |

| and attain so mu | ch motion | and change o | f figure as | that excess o | r defect of |

| weight in one o | f the scales | of a balance. |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ity the parts of | all fluids a | nd bodies grav | itate in th | eir proper p | laces ; and |
| therefore their | weights tak | en together c | ompose the | weight of | the whole. |

 less gravity,  descend  or ascend,  are comparatively  and  apparently  heavy  or
 light ; and  their comparative  and  apparent  gravity  or  levity  is the  excess
.or defect by which  their  true  gravity  either  exceeds  the  gravity  of  the
 water  or  is exceeded  by it.  But  those  things which  neither  by preponder
 ating  descend,  nor, by yielding  to the preponderating  fluid, ascend, although
 by  their  true  weight  they  do increase  the weight  of  the  whole,  yet  com
 paratively,  and  in the  sense  of the vulgar,  they do  not  gravitate  in the wa
 ter.  For  these  cases  are  alike demonstrated.

   COR.  7. These  things which  have  been demonstrated  concerning  gravity
 take  place  in any  other  centripetal  forces.
   COR.  8. Therefore  if the medium  in which  any body  moves  be acted  on
 either by  its own  gravity,  or by any  other  centripetal  force, and  the body
 be urged  more  powerfully  by  the same  force ; the  difference  of the forces  is
 that  very  motive  force, which,  in the foregoing  Propositions,  I have  con
sidered  as  a centripetal  force.  But  if the  body  be more  lightly urged by
 that  force, the difference  of the  forces becomes  a centrifugal  force, and  is tc
 be considered  as  such.

   COR.  9.  But  since  fluids by  pressing  the  included  bodies  do  not
change  their  external  figures,  it appears  also (by Cor.  Prop. XIX)  that they
will  not change  the situation  of  their  internal  parts  in  relation  to  onf
another  ; and  therefore  if animals  were  immersed  therein, and  that  all sen
sation  did  arise from  the motion  of their  parts,  the  fluid  will  neither  hurt
the immersed  bodies,  nor  excite  any  sensation,  unless  so far  as those  bodies
may  be condensed  by the compression.  And  the  case  is the  same  of any
system  of bodies encompassed  with  a compressing  fluid.  All  the  parts  of
the system  will  be agitated  with  the same  motions  as if they were  placed
in  a vacuum,  and  would  only  retain  their comparative  gravity  ; unless  so
far  as the fluid may  somewhat  resist  their  motions,  or be requisite  to  con-
glutinate  them  by compression.

£<et  the density  of any fluid  be proportional  to  the  compression,  and  its

de isity ; or the  triplicate  ratio  of  tlie force  the same  with  the quadruplicate
ratio of  the density  : in which  case, if  the gravity  he reciprocally  as  the
square  of the distance  from  the  centre,  the  density  will  be  reciprocally  at
the cube  of the distance.  Suppose  that  the cube  of  the compressing  force
be as the quadrato-cube  of the density  ; and  if the gravity  be  reciprocally
as the square  of the  distance,  the density  will  be  reciprocally  in  a  sesqui-
plicate  ratio  of the distance.  Suppose  the compressing  force  to be  in a du

tio of  the  distance, and  the  density  will be  reciprocally  as 'the  distance.
To  run  over  all the  cases  that might  bo offered  would  be tedious.  But  as
to our  own  air, this  is certain  from  experiment,  that  its density  is either
accurately,  or very  nearly  at least, as  the compressing  force ; and  therefore
the density  of the  air in the atmosphere  of the earth  is as the  weight  of
the whole  incumbent  air, that  is, as the height  of the mercury  in  the  ba
rometer.

        PROPOSITION   XXIII.   THEOREM   XVIII.

 If a fluid  be composed  of particles  mutually  flying  each  other, and  the
   drnsity  be as  the compression,  the  centrifugal  forces  of  the particles
    'will be reciprocally  proportional  to  tlie distances  of their  centres.    And,
   vice  versa,  particles flying  each  otli,er, with forces  that  are  reciprocally
  proportional  to the distances  of their  centres^ compose  an  elastic  fluid,
   whose  density  is as  the compression.
   Let  the  fluid  be supposed  to be  included  in  a  cubic
                                                                      Aspace ACE,  and  then  to be reduced  by compression  into
a lesser  cubic  space  ace  ; and  the distances  of the  par-  F
 tides  retaining  a  like  situation  with  respect  to  each
 other  in both  the  spaces,  will  be  as the sides AB,  ab  of
 the cubes  ; and  the densities  of the mediums  will  be  re
ciprocally  as the containing  spaces AB3,  ab3.    In  the
 plane  side  of the greater  cube  A BCD   take  the  square
 DP  equal  to the plane  side db  of the  lesser cube:  and,
 by the supposition,  the  pressure  with  which  the  square

   By  a like reasoning,  if the centrifugal  forces  of the particles  are  recip
rocally  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  distances  between  the  centres,  the cubes
of the compressing  forces  will  be  as the  biquadrates  of  the densities.  If
the centrifugal  forces  be reciprocally  in the triplicate  or quadruplicate  ratio
of the distances,  the cubes  of the compressing  forces  will  be as the quadrato-
cubes,  or cubo-cubes  of the densities.  And  universally,  if D  be put  for the
distance,  and  E  for the density  of the compressed  fluid, and  the centrifugal
forces  be reciprocally  as any  power  Dn  of the  distance,  whose  index  is the
number   ??, the compressing  forces  will  be  as the cube  roots  of the  power
En +   2. whose  index  is the number  n +  2 ; and  the contrary.  All  these
things  are  to be understood  of particles whose  centrifugal  forces  terminate
in those  particles  that  are  next  them,  or  are  diffused  not much  further.
We  have  an example  of this  in magnetical  bodies.  Their  attractive  vir
tue  is terminated  nearly  in bodies  of their own  kind  that  are  next  them.
The  virtue  of the magnet  is contracted  by the  interposition  of an  iron
plate, and  is almost  terminated  at it : for bodies  further  off are  not attracted
by the magnet  so much  as by the iron plate.  If in this manner  particles  repel
others  of their own  kind  that  lie next  them,  but  do not  exert  their  virtue
on  the more  remote,  particles  of this kind  will  compose  such  fluids  as  are
treated  of in this Proposition,  If the virtue  of any  particle  diffuse  itself

an  equal condensation  of  a  greater  quantity  of the  flui 1.  But  whether

elastic  fluids  do  really  consist  of particles  so repelling  each  other,  is a phy

of fluids consisting  of  particles  of  this kind,  that hence  philosophers  may
take  occasion  to discuss  that question.




                    SECTION   VI.

         Of  the motion  and  resistance  of funependulous  bodies.

         PROPOSITION   XXIV.   THEOREM   XIX.

The  quantities  of matter   i/i funependulous  bodies, whose  centres  of oscil
   lation  are  equally  distant  from,  the  centre  of suspension,  are in  a, ratio
  compounded  of the ratio  of the weights  and  the duplicate  ratio of  the
   times  of the oscillations  in vacuo.
   For  the velocity  which  a given  force  can  generate  in  a given  matter  in
a given  time  is as the force  and  the time  directly,  and  the matter  inversely.
The  greater  the  force  or the time  is, or the  less the matter,  the greater  ve
locity  will  he generated.  This  is manifest  from  the  second Law  of Mo
tion.  Now   if pendulums  are  of the same  length,  the motive  forces  in places
equally  distant  from  the perpendicular  are  as  the  weights  : and  therefore
if two  bodies  by oscillating  describe  equal  arcs, and  those  arcs  are  divided
into equal  parts ; since  the  times  in which  the bodies  describe  each  of  the
correspondent  parts  of the  arcs  are  as the times  of the  whole  oscillations,
the  velocities  in the correspondent  parts  of the oscillations  will  be  to each
other  as the motive  forces  and  the whole  times  of  the  oscillations  directly,
and  the quantities  of matter  reciprocally  : and  therefore  the  quantities  of
matter  are  as the  forces  and  the  times  of the  oscillations  directly and  the
velocities  reciprocally.  But  the  velocities  reciprocally  are  as  the  times,
and  therefore  the times  directly  and  the  velocities  reciprocally  are  as  the
squares  of the times;  and  therefore  the quantities  of matter  are  as the mo
tive  forces  and  the squares  of  the  times, that  is, as the  weights  and  the
squares  of the times.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  1. Therefore  if the times  are  equal, the  quantities  of matter  in
each  of the bodies  are  as the weights.

   COR.  3.  If the quantities  of matter  are  equal, the weights  will  be recip
rocally  as the squares  of the  times.
   COR.  4. Whence  since  the squares  of  the  times,  cceteris  paribus,  are  as
the length*  of the pendulums,  therefore  if both  the times  and  quantities  of
matter  are  equal,  the weights  will be  as the lengths  of the pendulums.

   COR.  5. And  universally,  the quantity  of matter  in the pendulous  body
is as the weight  and  the square  of the time  directly, and  the length  of the
pendulum  inversely.
   COR.  6. But  in  a non-resisting  medium,  the quantity  of matter  in  the
pendulous  body  is as the comparative  weight  and  the  square  of the  time
directly, and  the length  of the pendulum  inversely.  For  the comparative
weight  is the motive  force  of the body  in any heavy  medium,   as was shewn
above  ; and  therefore  does  the same  thing  in such  a non-resisting  medium
as the absolute  weight  does  in  a vacuum.
   COR.  7. And  hence  appears  a method  both  of comparing  bodies  one
among  another,  as  to the quantity  of matter  in  each  ; and  of comparing
the weights  of the same  body  in different  places,  to know  the variation  of
its gravity.  And  by experiments  made  with  the  greatest  accuracy,  I
have  always  found  the quantity  of matter  in bodies  to be proportional  to
their weight.

          PROPOSITION   XXV.   THEOREM   XX.

Funependulous  bodies  that  are,  in, any  'medium,  resisted  in  the  ratio  oj
   the moments  of time, and funepetidulons  bodies  that move  in  a  non-
   resisting medium  of the same  specific  gravity, perform  their  oscilla
   tions  in. a cycloid  in  the same  time, and  describe  proportional  parts  oj
   arcs  together.
                                         Let AB  be an  arc  of  a cycloid, which

                                      a body  D,  by vibrating  in  a  non-re
                                         sisting medium,  shall  describe  in any
                                  time.  Bisect  that  arc  in C, so that C
                                 may  be the lowest  point  thereof  ; and
                                           the accelerative  force  with  which  the

                                    body  is urged  in any  place D,  or d  or
                                      E, will be  as the length  of the arc CD,

pressed by that same  arc  ; and  since  the  resistance  is as the moment  of the
time, and  therefore  given,  let  it ba expressed  by the given  part CO  of the
cycloidal  arc, and  take  the  arc Od  in the same  ratio  to the  arc CD   that
the arc OB  has  to the  arc CB   : and  the  force with  which  the body  in d  is
urged  in  a resisting medium,  being  the  excess  of the  force Cd  above  the
resistance  CO,  will  be expressed  by the arc  Od, and  will  therefore  be  to
the  force with  which  the body D  is urged  in  a non-resisting  medium  in the
place D,  as the  arc Od  to the  arc CD  ; and  therefore  also in the  place B,
as the  arc OB   to the arc CB.   Therefore  if two  bodies  D, d go from  the place
B, and  are urged  by these  forces  ; since  the  forces  at the beginning  are  as
the  arc CB  and  OB,  the  first velocities  and  arcs  first described  will  be  in

tional  to those  arcs CD,  Od,  will remain  in the same  ratio  as  at  the  be
ginning,  and  therefore  the  bodies  will continue  describing  together  arcs  in
the same  ratio.  Therefore  the  forces  and  velocities  and  the remaining  arcs
CD.  Od,  will  be always  as the whole  arcs CB,  OB,  and  therefore  those  re
maining  arcs wLl  be described  together.  Therefore  the two  bodies D  and

non-resisting  medium,  at the  place C, and  the  other, in  the  resisting  me

CB,  OB,  the  arcs which  the bodies  describe when  they go farther  will  be
in the same  ratio.  Let  those  arcs  be CE  and Oe.  The  force with  which

the body D  in  a non-resisting  medium   is retarded  in E  is as CE,  and  the
force  with  which  the body  d  in the resisting medium   is retarded  in e, is as
the sum  of the  force  Ce  and  the resistance  CO,  that  is, as Oe ; and  there
fore  the forces  with  which  the bodies  are  retarded  are  as  the arcs CB, OB,
proportional  to the  arcs CE,  Oe  ; and  therefore  the  velocities, retarded  in
that given  ratio, remain  in the same  given ratio.  Therefore  the velocities
and  the  arcs described  with  those  velocities  are  always  to each  other  in
that given  ratio  of the  arcs CB  and OB  ; and  therefore  if the  entire  arcs
AB,  aB  are taken  in the same  ratio, the bodies D  andc/  will describe  those
aics  together,  and  in the places A  and  a  will  lose  all their motion  together.
Therefore  the whole  oscillations  are isochronal,  or  are performed  in  equal
times  ; and  any  parts  of the  arcs,  as BD,  Ed,  or BE,  Be, that  are described

upon  the lowest  point  C, but  is found  in that  point  O, in which  the whole
arc described  Ba  is bisected.  And  the body, proceeding  from  thence  to  a,
is retarded  at the same  rate  with  which  it was  accelerated  before  in  its de

Funependulous  bodies,  that  are  resisted  in the  ratio of  the velocity, have
                    their  oscillations  in  a cycloid  isochronal.

Therefore  if these  resistances  be subducted  from  or  added  to  the  motive
forces  arising from  gravity  which  are  as  the same  arcs, the  differences  or

If fnnependulous  bodies  are  resisted  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  their
   velocities,  the differences  between  the times  of the  oscillations  in  a  re
   sisting medium,  and  the times  of  the oscillations  in  a  non-resisting
  medium  of the same  specific gravity,  will  be proportional  to the  arcs
   described  in oscillating  nearly.

Prop.)  Therefore  the  resistance AA  in the arc  A, or AB  in  the  arc  B,
causes  the  excess  of the time  in the  arc A  above  the time  in a non-resisting
medium  ; and  the resistance BB  causes  the  excess  of the time  in the  arc B

greater,  because  the  resistance  in  the  descent  of  the  body, by which  the
time  is prolonged,  is greater,  in proportion  to  the  length  described  in the
descent  than  the  resistance  in the subsequent  ascent, by which  the  time  is
contracted.  But  the time  of the  oscillations,  both  short  arid long, seems  to

rectly and  the same  particle  of time  inversely.  Therefore,  since  the  re
sistance  is, by  the supposition,  as the square  of the  velocity,  the increment
of the  resistance  will (by Lem.  II) be as  the  velocity  and  the increment  of
the  velocity  conjunctly,  that  is, as the moment  of  the  space  and  V — R
conjunctly  ; and,  therefore,  if the moment  of the  space  be  given,  as V —
11 ; that  is, if for  the  force V  we  put  its exponent  PIGR,  and  the  resist

ance R  be expressed  by any  other  area Z; as PIGR  —  Z.v
  Therefore  the  area PIGR  uniformly  decreasing  by the subduction  of
given moments,  the  area Y  increases  in proportion  of PIGR  —  Y, and
the  area Z  in proportion  of PIGR  —  Z.  And  therefore  if the  areas
Y  and Z  begin  together,  and  at  the beginning  are  equal,  these, by  the
addition  of equal moments,  will continue  to be  equal  • and  in  like man
ner decreasing  by equal moments,  \vill vanish  together.  And,  vice  versa,
if they  together  begin  and  vanish,  they  will have  equal moments  and  te
always  equal ; and  that, because  if the  resistance  Z  be augmented,  the  ve
locity together  with  the  arc C«,  described  in the  ascent  of the body,  will be
diminished  ; and  the point  in which  all the motion  together  with  the  re
sistance  ceases  coming  nearer  to the point  C, the  resistance  vanishes  sooner
than  the  area Y.  And  the  contrary  will happen  when  the  resistance  is
diminished.

  Now  the area Z  begins  and  ends  where  the resistance  is nothing,  that  is,
at the beginning  of the motion  where  the  arc CD   is equal  to the  arc CB,

also where  the resistance  is nothing,  and  therefore where    IEF    and

IGH   are  equal  ; that  is (by the  construction),  where  the  right  line RG
falls successively  upon  the right  lines Q,E  and ST.  Therefore  those  areas
begin and vanish  together,  and  are therefore  always  equal.  Therefore  the area
OR
     IEF  — IGH   is equal  to the  area  Z, by which  the  resistance  is ex

pressed, and  therefore  is to  the  area PINM,  by which  the  gravity  is ex

IEF  as OR  to OQ.   For  in  that  case  its moment  (that  is, PIGR  —  Y)
becomes  nothing.
   COR.  3. Hence  also may  be known  the  velocity  in  each  place, as being
in the subduplicate  ratio  of the  resistance,  and  at the beginning  of the mo
tion equal  to the  velocity  of the body  oscillating  in the same  cycloid with
out  any  resistance.
  However,  by reason  of the  difficulty  of the calculation  by which  the  re
sistance  and  the velocity  are found  by this  Proposition,  we  have  thought
fit to subjoin  the Proposition  following.

        PROPOSITION   XXX.   THEOREM   XXIV.

If a right  line aB  be equal  to the  arc  of a cycloid which  an  oscillating
  body  describes,  and  at each  of its points D  the perpendiculars  DK   be
   erected, which  shall  be to the length  of the pendulum  as  the resistance
   of the body  in  the corresponding  points  of the  arc  to the force of grav
   ity ; I say,  that  the difference  between  the arc  described  in  the  whole
   descent  and  the arc  described  in  the whole  subsequent  ascent  drawn
   into half  the sum  of the same  arcs  will  be equal  to the  area BKa
  which  all those perpendiculars  take  up.
                                             Let  the  arc  of  the  cycloid, de
                                              scribed  in one  entire  oscillation,  be
                                        expressed  by  the  right  line  aB,
                                       equal  to  it, and  the  arc  which
                                         would  have  been  described  in vaciw

                                        by the length AB.   Bisect AB   in
                                           C, and  the point C  will  represent
                                              the lowest  point  of the cycloid, and
CD  Mill be  as the  force  arising from  gravity,  with  which  the body  in D   i,s
urged  in the direction  of the tangent  of the cycloid, and  will have  the same
ratio  to the length  of the pendulum  as  the force  in D  has  to the  force  of
gravity.  Let  that  force, therefore,  be  expressed  by that  length CD,  and
the force  of gravity  by the length  of  the pendulum  ; and  if in DE  you
take DK   in the same  ratio  to the length  of the pendulum  as the resistance
has  to the gravity, DK   will  be the exponent  of  the resistance.  From  the
centre C with the  interval CA  or CB  describe  a  semi-circle BEeA.   Let
the body  describe,  in the  least  time,  the space Dd  ; and, erecting  the per
pendiculars DE,  de, meeting  the circumference  in E  and  e, they  will be  as
the  velocities  which  the body  descending  in vacuo  from  the point B would
acquire  in the places D  and d.  This  appears by Prop,  LII, Book L  Let

therefore,  these  velocities  be  expressed  by those  perpendiculars  DE,  de ;
arid  let DF  be the  velocity  which  it acquires  in D  by falling from  B  in
the  resisting medium.  And   if from  the centre C  with  the interval OF  we
describe  the  circle F/M  meeting  the right  lines de  and AB   in /  and  M,
then M  will  be the place  to which  it would  thenceforward,  without  farther

resistance,  ascend, and  (//"the  velocity  it would  acquire  in d.  Whence,
also,  if FO-  represent  the moment   of the velocity which  the body  D, in de
scribing  the  least space  DC/, loses by the  resistance  of the medium  ; and
CN  be taken  equal  to Cg ; then  will N  be  the place  to which  the  body,  if
it met  no  farther  resistance, would  thenceforward  ascend,  and MN  will  be
the decrement  of the  ascent  arising from  the  loss of  that velocity.  Draw
F/n  perpendicular  to dft and  the decrement  Fg  of the velocity DF  gener
ated by the resistance DK   will  be  to the increment fm  of the  same  velo
city, generated  by the  force CD,  as the generating  force DK   to the gener

fm  is to Fm  or Dd  as CD   to DF  ; and, ex  ceqno, Fg  to Dd  as DK   to
DF.   Also Fh  is to Fg  as DF   to CF  ; and, ex  ax/uo  perturbate,  Fh  or

length  of the pendulum  the exponent  of the gravity,  the resistance  will be
to the gravity  as \Aa  to the length  of  the pendulum  ; altogether  as  in
Prop. XXVIII   is demonstrated.
   If the resistance  be as the  velocity,  the  figure BKTa   will  be nearly  an

sisting medium  will  be  as the ordinate  of the  circle  or  ellipsis  described
upon  the diameter  Ba  ; and  therefore  the figure BKVTa   will be nearly  ac
ellipsis.  Since  the resistance  is supposed  proportional  to  the velocity,  le\
OV  be  the exponent  of the  resistance  in the middle  point O  ; and  an  ellip
sis BRVSa   described  with  the centre  O, and  the semi-axes  OB,  OV,  will
be nearly  equal  to the figure BKVTa,  and  to its equal  the  rectangle  Act
X BO.   Therefore  Aa  X BO   is to OV  X BO  as the  area  of this  ellipsis
to OV  X BO;  that  is, Aa  is to OV  as the  area  of the  semi-circle  to the
square  of the radius,  or as  1 1 to 7 nearly  ; and,  therefore,  T7T Aa   is to the
length  of the pendulum  as the  resistance  of  the  oscillating body  in O  to
its gravity.
  Now   if the resistance DK   be  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity,  the
figure BKVTa   will be almost  a parabola  having  V  for  its vertex  arid OV
for  its axis, and  therefore  will  be nearly  equal  to the rectangle  under  f Ba
and OV.  Therefore  the rectangle  under |Ba  and Aa  is equal  to the  rec
tangle  f Ba  X  OV,  and  therefore OV   is equal  to f Aa  ; and  therefore  the
resistance  in O made  to the oscillating body  is to  its gravity  as f Aa  to the
length  of the pendulum.
   And  I take  these  conclusions  to be  accurate  enough  for  practical  uses.
For  since  an  ellipsis  or parabola BRVSa   falls in with  the figure BKVTa
in the middle  point V, that  figure, if greater  towards  the  part BRV   or
 VSa  than  the  other, is  less towards  the  contrary  part, and  is therefore
nearly  equal  to  it.

         PROPOSITION   XXXI.   THEOREM  XXV.

 If the resistance  made   to an  oscillating  body  in each  of  the proportional
   parts  of the arcs  described  be augmented  or diminished   in, a given  ra
    tio, the difference  between  the arc described  in  the descent  and  the  arc
   described  in the subsequent  ascent  ivill be augmented   or diminished  in
    the same  ratio.
                                           For  that  difference  arises  from
                                                the retardation  of  the pendulum
                                         by the resistance  of  the medium,
                                            and  therefore  is as  the whole  re
                                             tardation  and  the retarding  resist
                                                ance  proportional  thereto.  In the

   M   isr u           c    o        «.-/ n      P  gle under  the right  line  ^aB  and

 that  area,  if the length aB  remains,  is augmented  or diminished  in the  ra
 tio of the ordinates DK   ; that  is, in the  ratio  of the  resistance  and  is there
 fore  as the length aB  and  the  resistance  conjunctly.  And  therefore  the

               GENERAL  SCHOLIUM.

   From  these  propositions  we may  find the  resistance  of mediums  by pen
dulums  oscillating  therein.  I found  the  resistance  of  the  air by the  fol
lowing  experiments.  I suspended  a wooden  globe  or  ball weighing oT^
ounces  troy, its diameter  CJ London  inches, by a  fine thread  on  a  firm
hook,  so that  the distance  between  the hook  and  the  centre  of oscillation  of
 the globe was  10| feet.  I marked  on  the thread  a point  10 feet and  1 inch
distant  from  the centre  of suspension  • and  even  with  that  point  I placed  a
 ruler  divided  into  inches, by the help whereof  I observed  the lengths  of the
arcs  described  by the pendulum.  Then  I numbered  the  oscillations  ia
 which  the  globe would  lose  -{- part  of  its motion.  If the pendulum  was
drawn  aside from  the perpendicular  to the distance  of 2 inches, and  thence
 let go, so that  in  its whole  descent  it described  an  arc  of 2 inches, and  in
 the  first whole  oscillation, compounded  of  the  descent  and  subsequent
 ascent,  an  arc  of almost  4 inches,  the same  in 164  oscillations  lost j part
 of  its motion,  so  as in its  last  ascent  to describe  an  arc of  If inches.  If
 in the  first descent  it described  an  arc  of 4 inches,  it lost j part of  its mo
 tion  in 121  oscillations,  so as in  its last ascent  to describe  an  arc  of 3^
 inches.  If in the  first descent  it described  an  arc  of 8, 16, 32, or 64  inches,
 it lost | part  of  its motion  in  69, 35|,  18|-7 9|  oscillations,  respectively.
 Therefore  the  difference  between  the  arcs  described  in the  first descent  and

 the  last  ascent  was  in the  1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th  cases,  }, 1. 1, 2, 4, 8
 inches  respectively.  Divide  those  differences  by the number  of oscillations
 in each  case, and  in one  mean  oscillation, wherein  an  arc  of 3£ , 7-|, 15, 30

| let go, so that | in its whole | descent it | described a | n arc of 2 in | ches, and in |

| ascent, an arc | of almost 4 | inches, the | same in 16 | 4 oscillations | lost j part |

descent  and  subsequent  ascent  will be ¥|^, ^{^  e\>  T4r; -sji fir parts  of  an
inch, respectively.  But  these  differences  in the greater  oscillations  are in
the duplicate  ratio  of the  arcs  described  nearly,  but  in lesser  oscillations
something  greater  than  in that  ratio  ; and  therefore  (by Cor.  2, Prop. XXXI
of this Book)  the  resistance  of  the globe, when  it moves  very  swift, is in
the  duplicate  ratio  of 3^the  velocity, nearly;  and  when  it moves  slowly,
somewhat  greater  than  in that  ratio.
  Now   let V represent  the  greatest  velocity  in any  oscillation,  and  let A,
B, and  C  be given  quantities,  and  let us suppose  the  difference   of the  arcs

to be AV  +  BV2  + CV2.   Since  the greatest  velocities  are  in the cycloid
as ^ the arcs  described  in  oscillating,  and  in the  circle  as | the chords  of
those  arcs ; and  therefore  in equal  arcs  are  greater  in the cycloid  than  in
 the  circle  in  the  ratio  of | the  arcs  to their  chords ; but  the  times  in the
circle  are  greater  than  in the  cycloid,  in  a reciprocal  ratio  of  the velocity ;
 it is plain  that  the  differences  of the  arcs (which  are  as the resistance  and
 the square  of  the time  conjunctly)  are nearly  the same  in both  curves  : for
 in the cycloid those  differences  must  be on  the one hand  augmented,  with
 the  resistance,  in about  the duplicate  ratio  of  the  arc  to the  chord,  because
 of the  velocity augmented  in  the  simple  ratio  of  the same  ; and  on  the
 other hand  diminished,  with  the square  of  the  time,  in the same  duplicate
 ratio.  Therefore  to reduce  these  observations  to the  cycloid, we  must  take
 the same  differences  of  the  arcs  as were  observed  in the  circle, and  suppose
 the greatest  velocities analogous  to  the  half, or  the whole  arcs,  that  is, to
 the numbers  ±, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.  Therefore  in the 2d, 4th, and  6th  cases, put
 1,4, and  1 6 for V ; and  the  difference  of the  arcs  in the 2d  case  will become

| it is plain that | the | differences | of the arcs ( | whi | ch are as the re | sistance and |

             ya
   The  arc, which  the point marked  in the thread  described  in the 6th  case,

was  of 120 —   Q^, or 119/g  inches.   And  therefore  since  the  radius  was

121  inches, and  the  length  of  the pendulum  between  the point  of suspen
sion and  the centre  of the globe was  126  inches,  the  arc which  the centre  of
the globe described  was 124/T  inches.  Because  the greatest  velocity  of the
oscillating  body, by reason  of  the resistance  of the  air, does  not  fall on  the
lowest  point  of the  arc  described,  but  near  the middle  place of  the whole
arc, this velocity  will  be nearly  the same  as if the globe  in  its whole  descent
in  a non-resisting  medium  should  describe  62 ^  inches,  the half  of that  arc,
and  that  in  a cycloid,  to which  we  have  above  reduced  the motion  of  the
pendulum;  and  therefore  that  velocity  will  be  equal  to  that which  the
globe would  acquire  by falling  perpendicularly  from  a height  equal  to the
versed  sine  of  that arc.  But  that versed  sine  in the cycloid  is to that  arc
62/2  as the same  arc  to twice  the length  of  the pendulum  252, and  there
fore equal  to 15,278  inches.  Therefore  the velocity  of the pendulum   is the
same  which  a body would  acquire  by falling, and  in  its fall describing  a
space  of 15,278  inches.  Therefore  with  such  a velocity  the globe  meets
with  a resistance  which  is to  its weight  as 0,61705  to 121,  or (if we  take
that  part only of  the  resistance  which  is in the  duplicate  ratio of  the  ve-
loc.ty)  as 0,56752  to 121.
   I found, by an hydrostatical  experiment,  that  the weight  of  this wooden
globe was  to the weight  of  a globe  of water  of  the same  magnitude  as 55
to 97:  and  therefore  since  121  is to 213,4  in the same  ratio, the  resistance
made  to  this  globe  of water, moving  forwards  with  the  above-mentioned
velocity,  will  be to its weight  as 0,56752  to  213,4,  that  is, as 1 to 376^.
Whence  since  the weight  of  a globe  of water,  in the  time  in which  the
globe with  a  velocity uniformly  continued  describes  a length  of 30,556
inches, will  generate  all that  velocity  in  the  falling  globe,  it is manifest
that  the force  of resistance  uniformly  continued  in the same  time  will  take
away   a velocity, which  will  be  less than  the  other  in the  ratio  of 1 to 376^-0,

              37 VSG that  is, the rr^-r  part  of  the whole  velocity.   And  therefore  in the  time

 Jiat  the globe, with  the same  velocity uniformly  continued,  would  describe
the length  of  its semi-diameter,  or 3T\  inches,  it would  lose the 3^42  part
of  its motion.
   I also counted  the  oscillations  in which  the pendulum  lost j part  of  its
motion.   In the following  table  the upper  numbers  denote  the length  of the
arc described  in the  first descent,  expressed  in inches  and  parts  of an inch ;
the middle  numbers  denote  the  length  of  the arc  described  in the  last  as
cent  ; and  in the lowest  place  are  the numbers  of the oscillations.  I give
 un  account  of this experiment,  as being more  accurate  than  that  in which

| The arc, wh | ich the p | oint mark | ed in the thread | described | in the 6th case, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| was of 120 — | Q^, or 1 | 19/g inch | es. And there | fore since | the radius was |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 121 inches, an | d the le | ngth of t | he pendulum be | tween the | point of suspen |
| sion and the c | entre of | the globe | was 126 inches, | the arc whi | ch the centre of |
| the globe descr | ibed was | 124/T i | nches. Because | the greates | t velocity of the |
| oscillating bod | y, by rea | son of th | e resistance of t | he air, does | not fall on the |
| lowest point o | f the arc | describe | d, but near the | middle pla | ce of the whole |
| arc, this veloci | ty will be | nearly t | he same as if the | globe in | its whole descent |
| in a non-resist | ing medi | um shoul | d describe 62 ^ | inches, the | half of that arc, |
| and that in a | cycloid, t | o which | we have above | reduced th | e motion of the |
| pendulum; an | d theref | ore that | velocity will be | equal to | that which the |
| globe would a | cquire by | falling | perpendicularly | from a hei | ght equal to the |
| versed sine of | that arc | . But th | at versed sine i | n the cyclo | id is to that arc |
| 62/2 as the s | ame arc t | o twice t | he length of the | pendulum | 252, and there |
| fore equal to 1 | 5,278 in | ches. The | refore the veloc | ity of the | pendulum is the |
| same which a | body wou | ld acqui | re by falling, a | nd in its | fall describing a |
| space of 15,2 | 78 inche | s. Theref | ore with such | a velocity | the globe meets |
| with a resista | nce which | is to its | weight as 0,61 | 705 to 121 | , or (if we take |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that part only | of the | resistance | which is in the | duplicate | ratio of the ve- |
| loc.ty) as 0,56 | 752 to 1 | 21. |  |  |  |
| I found, by | an hydros | tatical e | xperiment, that | the weight | of this wooden |
| globe was to | the weight | of a gl | obe of water of | the same | magnitude as 55 |

| Whence since | the wei | ght of a | globe of water, | in the ti | me in which the |

that is, t he rr | ^ V-SrG part | of the w | hole velocity. | And there | fore in the time |

 6f and  2 inches, and  the squares  of these  are  to each  other  as 47 £ and  4,

 globes were  in less than  a duplicate  ratio  of  the diameters.  But  we  have
 not  yet considered  the  resistance  of the  thread, which  was  certainly  very
 considerable,  and  ought  to be subducted  from  the  resistance  of  the pendu

greater  than  a third  part of  the whole  resistance  of  the  lesser pendulum  ;
and  thence  I gathered  that  the  resistances  of  the globes, when  the  resist
ance  of the  thread  is subducted,  are  nearly  in the duplicate  ratio of  their

diameters.  For  the  ratio  of 7} —  } to 1 —   £, or l(H  to 1 is not  very
different  from  the duplicate  ratio  of the diameters  1 L}f  to  I.
   Since  the resistance  of the thread  is of less moment  in greater  globes, I
tried  the experiment  also with  a  globe whose  diameter  was  ISf  inches.
The  length  of the pendulum  between  the point  of suspension  and  the  cen
tre  of oscillation  was  122|  inches, and  between  the point  of suspension  and
the knot  in the thread  109|  inches.  The  arc described  by the knot  at the
first descent  of the pendulum  was  32  inches.  The  arc  described  by  the
same  knot  in the  last ascent  after  five  oscillations  was  2S  inches.  The
sum  of the  arcs, or  the whole  arc described  in one mean  oscillation,  was  60

inches.  The  difference  of the  arcs 4 inches.  The   y1,,- part  of  this, or the
difference  between  the descent  and  ascent  in  one  mean  oscillation,  is f of

an inch.  Then  as the radius  10(J|  to the radius  122^,  so  is the whole  arc
of 60  inches  described  by the knot  in one  mean  oscillation  to the whole  arc
of 67}  inches  described  by the centre  of the globe  in one  mean  oscillation  ;
and  so is the  difference  | to  a new  difference 0,4475.   If the length  of the
 arc described  were  to remain,  and  the length  of the pendulum  should  be
augmented  in the  ratio  of 126  to 122},  the  time  of  the  oscillation  would
 be augmented,  and  the velocity  of the pendulum  would  be  diminished  in
 the subduplicate  of that  ratio  ; so that  the  difference  0,4475  of the  arcs de
scribed  in the descent  and  subsequent  ascent  would  remain.  Then  if the

 arc described  be augmented  in the  ratio of  124  33T to  67}, that  difference
 0.4475  would  be augmented  in the duplicate  of  that  ratio, and  so would
 become  1,5295.  These  things would  be  so upon  the  supposition  that  the
 resistance  of  the pendulum  were  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity.

 Therefore  if the pendulum  describe  the whole  arc  of 12433T  inches, and  its
 length  between  the point  of suspension  and  the centre  of oscillation  be 126
 inches,  the  difference  of the  arcs described  in  the  descent  and  subsequent
 ascent  would  be 1,5295  inches.  And  this  difference  multiplied  into  the
 weight  of the pendulous  globe, which  was  208  ounces,  produces  318,136.
 Again ; in the pendulum  above-mentioned,  made  of  a wooden  globe, when
 its centre  of oscillation, being  126  inches  from  the  point  of suspension,  de
 scribed  the whole  arc  of 124 /T inches,  the  difference  of  the arcs  described

 in the descent  and  ascent  was ^^i/wi  into  ^.y^    This   multiplied    into   the

 weight  of the  globe, which  was  57-272 ounces,  produces 49,396.  But  I mul
 tiply these  differences  into  the weights  of the globes,  in order  to find  their
 resistances.  For  the  differences  arise from  the resistances, and  are  as the
 resistances  directly  and  the weights  inversely.  Therefore  the  resistances
 are  as the numbers  318,136  and 49,396.  But  that part  of the  resistance

| greater than a | th | ird part of | the whole | resistanc | e of the le | sser p | endulum ; |
| and thence I g | ath | ered that | the resista | nces of t | he globes, w | hen | the resist |
| ance of the t | hre | ad is subduc | ted, are ne | arly in t | he duplicate | rati | o of their |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| diameters. Fo | r | the ratio | of 7} — } | to 1 — | £, or l(H t | o 1 is | not very |
| different from | the | duplicate | ratio of th | e diameter | s 1 L }f to | I. |  |
| Since the re | sis | tance of th | e thread is | of less mo | ment in g | reater | globes, I |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tried the exper | im | ent also wi | th a globe | whose | diameter w | as I | Sf inches. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The length of | th | e pendulum | between t | he point | of suspensio | n and | the cen |
| tre of oscillati | on | was 122| | inches, and | between | the point of | suspe | nsion and |
| the knot in th | e t | hread 109| | inches. T | he arc d | escribed by | the k | not at the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| first descent of | th | e pendulum | was 32 | inches. | The arc de | scrib | ed by the |
| same knot in | the | last ascent | after five | oscillati | ons was 2S | inc | hes. The |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sum of the arcs | , o | r the whole | arc descri | bed in on | e mean osci | llati | on, was 60 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| inches. The | dif | ference of t | he arcs 4 i | nches. T | he y1,,- p art | of t | his, or the |
| difference betw | een | the desce | nt and asc | ent in on | e mean osc | illati | on, is f of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| an inch. The | n | as the radiu | s 10(J| to | the radiu | s 122^, so | is the | whole arc |
| of 60 inches d | esc | ribed by th | e knot in o | ne mean | oscillation | to the | whole arc |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of 67} inches | des | cribed by | the centre o | f the glob | e in one me | an o | scillation ; |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and so is the | diff | erence | to | a new diff | erence 0, | 4475. If th | e len | gth of the |
| arc described | wer | e to remain | , and the | length of | the pendu | lum | should be |
| augmented in | the | ratio of 1 | 26 to 122}, | the time | of the os | cillat | ion would |
| be augmented, | an | d the veloc | ity of the | pendulum | would be | dim | inished in |
| the subduplica | te | of that rat | io ; so that | the diffe | rence 0,4475 | of t | he arcs de |
| scribed in the | de | scent and s | ubsequent | ascent wo | uld remain | . Th | en if the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| arc described | be | augmented | in the ratio | of 124 | 33T to 67}, | that | difference |
| 0.4475 would | be | augmented | in the dup | licate of | that ratio | , and | so would |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| become 1,529 | 5. | These thi | ngs would | be so upon | the suppo | sitio | n that the |
| resistance of | the | pendulum | were in t | he duplic | ate ratio | of th | e velocity. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Therefore if | the | pendulum | describe the | whole a | rc of 12433T | inch | es, and its |
| length between | t | he point of | suspension | and the | centre of os | cillat | ion be 126 |
| inches, the dif | fer | ence of the | arcs descri | bed in t | he descent | and | subsequent |

of the  lesser  globe, which  is in the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity,  was  to
the whole  resistance  as 0,56752   to- 0,61675,  that  is, as 45,453  to 49,396  ;
whereas  that  part  of the resistance  of the greater  globe  is almost  equal  to
its whole  resistance  ; and  so those  parts  are  nearly  as 318,136  and  45,453,
that  is, as 7 and 1.  But  the diameters  of the globes  are 18f  and 6| ; and
their squares  351T9¥  and  47 £J  are  as 7,438  and  1, that  is, as the resistances
of the globes  7 and  1, nearly.  The  difference  of  these  ratios  is scarce
greater  than may  arise from  the resistance  of the thread.  Therefore  those
parts  of the resistances  which  are, when  the  globes  are equal,  as the squares
of the  velocities,  are  also, when  the  velocities  are  equal, as the  squares  of
the diameters  of the globes.
  But  the greatest  of the globes  I used  in these experiments  was  not  per

fectly spherical,  and  therefore  in this calculation  I have,  for brevity's  sake,
neglected  some  little  niceties ; being  not  very  solicitous  for  an  accurate
calculus  in an experiment  that  was  not  very accurate.  So  that  I could
wish  that  these experiments  were  tried again  with  other  globes,  of a larger
size, more  in number,  and  more  accurately  formed  ; since  the demonstra
tion  of  a vacuum  depends  thereon.  If the globes  be taken  in  a geometrical
proportion,  as suppose  whose  diameters  are  4, 8, 16, 32  inches;  one  may
collect from  the progression  observed  in the experiments  what  would  hap
pen  if the globes  were  still larger.
   In order  to compare  the  resistances  of different  fluids with  each  other, 1
made  the following  trials.  I procured  a wooden  vessel  4 feet long,  1 foot
broad, and  1 foot high.  This  vessel, being  uncovered,  1 filled with  spring
water,  and, having  immersed  pendulums  therein,  I made  them  oscillate  in
the water.  And  I found  that  a leaden  globe weighing  166|  ounces,  and  in
diameter  3f inches, moved  therein  as it is set down  in  the following  table ;
the length  of  the pendulum  from  the  point  of suspension  to  a  certain
point marked  in the thread  being 126  inches, and  to the centre  of  oscilla

   In  the experiments  of the 4th column  there were  equal motions  lost in
535  oscillations  made  in the  air, and  If in water.  The  oscillations  in the
air were  indeed  a little swifter  than  those  in the water.  But  if the  oscil
lations  in the water  were  accelerated  in such  a  ratio  that  the motions  of
the pendulums  might  be equally  swift  in both  mediums,  there  would  be
still the same  number   1 j  of  oscillations  in the  water, and  by these  the
same  quantity  of motion  would  be  lost as before  ; because  the resistance  i>
increased,  and  the square  of the time  diminished  in the same  duplicate  ra
tio.  The  pendulums,  therefore,  being  of equal  velocities,  there  were  equal
motions  lost in 535  oscillations  in the  air, and  1} in the water;  and  there
fore  the resistance  of the pendulum  in the water  is to its resistance  in the
air  as 535  to  1 }.  This  is the proportion  of  the whole  resistances  in  the
case  of the 4th  column.

  Now   let AV  +  CV2  represent  the  difference  of the  arcs  described  in the
descent  and  subsequent  ascent  by the globe moving  in air with  the greatest
velocity V  ; and  since  the greatest  velocity  is in the  case  of the 4th column
to the greatest  velocity  in the  case  of the  1st column  as 1 to 8 ; and  that
difference  of the arcs  in the  case  of the  4th column  to the  difference  in the
                                        2       16
case  of the  1st column  as  ^     to     7, or as  86 J to  4280  ; put   in   these

cases  1 and  8 for the  velocities, and  85 1 and  4280  for  the  differences  of
the  arcs, and A  +  C  will  be —  S5|, and 8A  -f 640  ==• 4280  or A  +  SC
=  535  ; and  then  by reducing  these  equations,  there  will come  out TC =
449^  and  C =  64T\  and A =  21f  ; and  therefore  the resistance, which  is
as TVAV  +  fCV2,  will become  as 13T6TV + 48/^Y2.  Therefore  in  the
case  of the 4th column,  where  the velocity  was  1, the whole  resistance  is to
its part  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  velocity  as  13T6T + 48/F  or
61 }f  to 48/e  ; and  therefore  the resistance  of the pendulum  in water  is to
that  part  of the resistance  in  air, which  is proportional  to the square  of the
velocity, and  which  in swift motions  is the only part  that deserves  consid
eration,  as 61}^  to 4S/g  and  535  to 1}  conjunctly,  that  is, as 571  to  1.
 If the whole  thread  of the pendulum  oscillating  in the water  had  been  im
mersed,  its resistance  would  have  been  still greater  ; so that  the  resistance
 of the pendulum  oscillating  in the water,  that  is, that  part which  is pro
portional  to the square  of the  velocity, and  which  only needs  to be consid
 ered  in swift  bodies,  is to the resistance  of the same  whole  pendulum,  oscil
 lating  in air with  the same  velocity,  as about  850  to 1, that  is as, the den
 sity of water  to the density  of air, nearly.
    In  this calculation  we  ought  also  to have  taken  in that  part  of the  re
 sistance  of the pendulum  in the water  which  was  as the square  of the  ve
 locity ; but  I found  (which  will perhaps  seem  strange)  that  the  resistance
 in the water  was  augmented  in more  than  a duplicate  ratio  of the velocity.
 In searching  after  the  cause,  I thought  upon  this, that  the  vessel  was  toe

narrow  for the magnitude  of the pendulous  globe, and  by its narrowness
obstructed  the motion  of the water  as  it yielded  to  the  oscillating  globe.
For when  I immersed  a pendulous  globe, whose  diameter  was  one  inch  only,
the resistance  was augmented  nearly  in a duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity,
I tried  this by making  a pendulum  of two  globes, of which  the  lesser and
lower  oscillated  in the water, and  the  greater  and  higher  was  fastened  to
the thread  just above  the water,  and, by oscillating  in the  air, assisted  the
motion  of the pendulum,  and  continued  it longer.  The  experiments  made
by this contrivance  proved  according  to the following  table.

   In comparing  the  resistances  of the mediums  with  each  other,  I also
caused  iron pendulums  to oscillate  in quicksilver.  The  length  of the  iron
wire  was  about  3 feet, and  the diameter  of the pendulous  globe about  i of
an inch.  To  the  wire, just above  the quicksilver,  there was  fixed another
leaden  globe  of a bigness  sufficient  to continue  the motion  of  the pendulum
for some  time.  Then   a vessel, that would  hold  about  3 pounds  of quick
silver, was  filled by turns with  quicksilver  and common   water,  that, by
making  the pendulum  oscillate  successively  in these  two  different  fluids, I
might  find  the proportion  of their  resistances  ; and  the  resistance  of  the
quicksilver  proved  to be  to the resistance  of water  as about  13  or 14  to  1 ;
that  is. as the density  of quicksilver  to the density  of water.  When   I made
use  of  a pendulous  globe something  bigger,  as of  one  whose  diameter  was
about  ^ or | of an  inch,  the resistance  of the quicksilver  proved  to be  to
the resistance  of the water  as about  12  or 10  to 1.  But  the former  experi
ment  is more  to be relied  on, because  in the latter  the  vessel was  too  nar
row  in proportion  to the magnitude  of the immersed  globe;  for the  vessel
ought  to have  been  enlarged  together  with  the globe.  I intended  to have
repeated  these experiments  with  larger  vessels, and  in melted  metals,  and
other  liquors  both  cold and  hot ; but  I had  not  leisure  to try all: and  be
sides, from  what  is already  described,  it appears  sufficiently  that  the  resist
ance  of bodies moving  swiftly  is nearly  proportional  to  the  densities  of
the  fluids  in which  they move.   I do  not  say  accurately ; for more  tena
cious  fluids, of equal  density,  will undoubtedly  resist more  than  those  that
are more  liquid ; as cold  oil more  than  warm,  warm   oil more  than  rain
water,  and  water  more  than  spirit  of wine.  But  in liquors, which  are  sen
sibly  fluid enough,  as in air, in salt and  fresh  water,  in  spirit of  wine,  of
turpentine,  and  salts, in  oil cleared  of its fseces by distillation  and warmed,
in  oil of vitriol, and  in  mercury,  and  melted  metals, and  any  other  such
like, that  are  fluid enough  to retaia  for some  time  the motion  impressed

| In comparin | g the resistanc | es of the me | diums with each ot | her, I also |
| caused iron pe | ndulums to oscil | late in quick | silver. The length o | f the iron |
| wire was about | 3 feet, and the | diameter of | the pendulous globe a | bout i of |
| an inch. To | the wire, just ab | ove the quick | silver, there was fixe | d another |
| leaden globe o | f a bigness suffi | cient to contin | ue the motion of the | pendulum |
| for some time | . Then a vessel, | that would | hold about 3 pounds | of quick |
| silver, was fil | led by turns wit | h quicksilver | and common water, | that, by |
| making the pe | ndulum oscillate | successively | in these two different | fluids, I |
| might find the | proportion of t | heir resistanc | es ; and the resistan | ce of the |
| quicksilver pr | oved to be to the | resistance of | water as about 13 or | 14 to 1 ; |
| that is. as the | density of quicks | ilver to the d | ensity of water. Whe | n I made |
| use of a pendu | lous globe somet | hing bigger, | as of one whose diam | eter was |
| about ^ or | o | f an inch, the re | sistance of th | e quicksilver proved | to be to |

 upon  them  by  the agitation  of the  vessel, and  which  being poured  out  are
 easily resolved  into  drops,  I doubt  not  but  the  rule already  laid down  may
 be  accurate  enough,  especially  if the  experiments  be made  with  larger
 pendulous  bodies  and  more  swiftly moved.
   Lastly,  since  it is the  opinion  of some  that  there  is a certain  ^ethereal
medium  extremely  rare  and  subtile, which  freely pervades  the  pores  of  all
 bodies ; and from  such  a medium,  so pervading  the pores  of bodies, some  re

 sistance must  needs  arise;  in order  to try whether  the  resistance,  which  wre
 experience  in bodies  in motion,  be made  upon  their outward  superficies  only,
 or whether  their  internal  parts meet  with  any  considerable  resistance  upon
their  superficies,  I thought  of the  following experiment  I suspended  a
round  deal box  by a thread  11 feet  long,  on  a steel hook,  by means   of a ring
of the  s-ime  metal,  so  as to make   a pendulum  of the  aforesaid  length.  The
hook  had  a sharp  hollowr  edge on  its upper  part,  so that the  upper  arc  of
the ring pressing  on  the edge might move  the more  freely ; and  the  thread
was  fastened  to the lower  arc  of  the ring.  The  pendulum  being  thus  pre
pared,  I drew  it aside from  the  perpendicular  to the  distance  of about  6
feet, and  that  in  a plane  perpendicular  to  the  edge  of the  hook,  lest the
ring, while  the pendulum  oscillated, should  slide  to and  fro on  the edge  of
the hook  : for the point of suspension,  in which  the ring touches  the  hook,
ought  to remain  immovable.  I therefore  accurately  noted  the  place  to
which  the pendulum  was  brought,  and  letting  it go, I marked  three  other
places,  to which  it returned  at the  end  of  the  1st, 2d, and  3d  oscillation.
This  I often  repeated,  that  I might  find  those  places  as accurately  as pos
sible.  Then  I filled the  box  with  lead  and  other  heavy  metals  that  were
near  at hand.  But,  first, I weighed  the box when  empty,  and  that  pnrt  of
the thread  that  went  round  it, and  half  the remaining  part, extended  be
tween  the hook  and  the suspended  box ; for  the  thread  so extended  always
acts upon  the pendulum,  when  drawn  aside from  the perpendicular,  with  half
its weight.  To  this weight  I added  the weight  of  the  air contained  in the
box  And  this whole  weight  was  about  -fj of  the weight  of  the box when
filled  writh  the metals.  Then  because  the box  when  full of the  metals, by ex
tending  the  thread  with  its weight,  increased  the length  of the pendulum,
f shortened  the thread  so  as  to make  the length  of  the pendulum,  when   os
cillating,  the same  as before.  Then  drawing  aside  the pendulum  to  the
place  first marked,  and  letting  it go, I reckoned  about  77  oscillations  before
the box  returned  to the second  mark,  and  as many  afterwards  before  it came
to the third  mark,  and  as many  after  that  before  it came  to the  fourth
xnark.  From  whence  I conclude  that  the whole  resistance  of the  box, when
full, had  not  a greater  proportion  to the resistance  of the box, when  empty,
than  78  to 77.  For  if their  resistances  were  equal,  the  box, when  full, by
reason  of  its vis  insita, which  was  78 times  greater  than  the  vis tfuritoof
the same  when  empty,  ought  to have  continued  its oscillating  motion   so                                    21

| Lastly, s | ince it | is the opinion o | f some that | there is a certai | n ^ethereal |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| experience | in bodie | s in motion, be m | ade upon their | outward superf | icies only, |
| or whether | their i | nternal parts meet | with any con | siderable resis | tance upon |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| their superf | icies, I | thought of the | following ex | periment I s | uspended a |
| round deal | box by | a thread 11 feet | long, on a stee | l hook, by mean | s of a ring |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the s-ime | metal, | so as to make a | pendulum of t | he aforesaid le | ngth. The |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| hook had a | sharp | hollowr edge on | its upper part, | so that the u | pper arc of |
| the ring pre | ssing o | n the edge might | move the mo | re freely ; and | the thread |
| was fastened | to the | lower arc of th | e ring. The | pendulum being | thus pre |
| pared, I dre | w it as | ide from the pe | rpendicular t | o the distance | of about 6 |
| feet, and t | hat in a | plane perpendic | ular to the | edge of the hoo | k, lest the |
| ring, while | the pe | ndulum oscillated | , should slide | to and fro on | the edge of |
| the hook : | for the | point of suspensi | on, in which t | he ring touches | the hook, |
| ought to r | emain | immovable. I t | herefore accur | ately noted th | e place to |
| which the p | endulu | m was brought, | and letting it | go, I marked | three other |
| places, to w | hich it | returned at the | end of the 1s | t, 2d, and 3d | oscillation. |
| This I often | repeat | ed, that I might | find those pl | aces as accurate | ly as pos |
| sible. Then | I fill | ed the box with | lead and othe | r heavy metals | that were |
| near at han | d. But | , first, I weighed | the box when | empty, and t | hat pnrt of |
| the thread | that we | nt round it, a nd | half the rem | aining part, ex | tended be |

| acts upon th | e pendu | lum, when drawn | aside from th | e perpendicular, | with half |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| its weight. | To th | is weight I added | the weight o | f the air contai | ned in the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| box And | this wh | ole weight was a | bout -fj of the | weight of the | box when |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| filled writh t | he meta | ls. Then becaus | e the box when | full of the met | als, by ex |

much  the longer, and  therefore  to have  returned  to those marks  at the  end
 of 78  oscillations.  But  it returned  to them  at the end  of 77  oscillations.
   Let,  therefore, A  represent  the  resistance  of the box  upon  its external
superficies,  and  B  the resistance  of the empty  box  on  its internal  superficies ;
and  if the  resistances  to the  internal  parts  of bodies  equally  swift  be  as the
matter,  or the number  of particles  that  are  resisted,  then 78B  will  be the
resistance  made  to the internal  parts  of  the box, when  full ; and  therefore
the whole  resistance A +  B  of the empty  box  will be  to the whole  resist
ance A  +  7SB  of the  full box  as 77  to 78, and, by division, A +  B  to 77B
as 77  to  1 ; and  thence A  +  B  to B  as 77 X  77  to  1, and, by division
again, A  to B  as 5928  to 1.  Therefore  the resistance  of the empty  box  in
its internal  parts  will  be  above 5000  times  less than  the  resistance  on  its
external  superficies.  This  reasoning  depends  upon  the supposition  that  the
greater  resistance  of  the  full box  arises  not from  any  other  latent  cause,

   This  experiment  is related  by memory,  the  paper  being  lost in which  I
had  described  it ; so that  I have  been  obliged  to omit  some  fractional  parts,
which  are  slipt out  of my  memory  ; and  I have  no  leisure  to  try it again.
The  first time  I made  it, the hook  being weak,  the full  box was  retarded
sooner.  The  cause  I found  to be, that  the hook  was  not strong  enough  to
bear  the weight  of  the box  : so that, as  it  oscillated  to and  fro, the  hook
was  bent sometimes  this and  sometimes  that way.  I therefore  procured  a
hook  of sufficient  strength,  so that  the point  of suspension  might  remain
unmoved,  and  then  all things happened  as  is above  described.

   Of  the, motion  of fluids, and  the resistance  made   to projected  bodies.

        PROPOSITION   XXXII.   THEOREM   XXVI.

 Suppose  two  similar  systems  of bodies  consisting  of an  equal number  of
   particles, and  let the correspondent  particles  be similar  and  propor
   tional, each  in, one  system  to each  in  the  other, and  have  a like situa
   tion among  themselves, and  the same  given  ratio  of density  to each
   other ; and  let them  begin  to move  anwng  themselves  in proportional
   times, and  with  like motions  (that  is, those  in one  system among   one
   another,  and  those  in  the other among  one  another).  And  if the par
    ticles that  are  in the same  system  do  not  touch  otte another,  except  ir
   the moments  of reflexion  ; nor  attract,  nor  repel each  other, except  with
   accelerativeforc.es  that  are  as  the diameters  of the correspondent  parti
   cles inversely,  and  the squares  of the  velocities  directly  ; I say,  that  the
  particles  of those systems  will continue  to move  among  themselves  wit  It
   like motions  and  in proportional  times.

   Like  bodies  in like  situations  are  said  to be moved  among  themselves
with  like motions  and  in proportional  times, when  their  situations  at the
end  of those  times  are  always  found  alike  in respect  of  each  other ; as sup
pose  we  compare  the  particles  in one  system  with  the  correspondent  parti
cles in the other.  Hence  the times  will be proportional,  in which  similar
and  proportional  parts  of similar  figures  will  be described  by correspondent
particles.  Therefore  if we  suppose  two  systems  of  this  kind; the  corre
spondent  particles, by  reason  of the  similitude  of the  motions  at  their
beginning,  will  continue  to be moved  with  like  motions,  so long  as  they
move  without  meeting  one  another  ; for  if they are  acted  on by no  forces,
they  will go  on uniformly  in right  lines, by the  1st Law.  But  if they do
agitate  one  another  with  some  certain  forces, and  those  forces  are  as  the
diameters  of the  correspondent  particles  inversely  and  the  squares  of  the
velocities  directly,  then, because  the  particles  are in  like  situations,  and
their  forces  are  proportional,  the whole  forces  with which  correspondent
particles  are  agitated,  and  which  are compounded  of each  of  the agitating
forces  (by Corol.  2 of the  Laws),  will have  like  directions, and  have  the
same  effect  as if they respected  centres  placed  alike  among  the  particles ;
and  those whole  forces  will be  to each  other  as  the  several  forces which

compose  them,  that  is, as  the  diameters  of the  correspondent  particles  in
versely, and  the squares  of the  velocities  directly  : and  therefore  will  cans**

correspondent  particles  to continue  to describe  like figures.  These  things
will be so (by Cor.  1 and  S, Prop.  IV.; Book  1), if those  centres  are  at rest
but if they  are moved,  yet by reason  of the similitude  of the translations,
 their situations among  the particles  of the system  will remain  similar , so
 that the changes  introduced  into  the figures described  by the particles  will
still be similar.  So  that  the  motions  of correspondent  and  similar  par
ticles will continue  similar  till their  first meeting  with  each  other ; and
thence  will  arise similar  collisions, and  similar  reflexions;  which  will again
beget similar  motions  of the particles among  themselves  (by what  was  just
now  shown),  till they mutually  fall upon  one  another  again, and  so on  ad
infinitum.
   COR.  1. Hence  if any two  bodies, which  are  similar  and  in like situations
to the correspondent  particles  of the systems,  begin  to move  amongst  them
in like manner  and  in proportional  times, and  their magnitudes  and  densi
ties be to each  other  as the magnitudes  and  densities  of  the corresponding
particles,  these  bodies  will continue  to be moved  in like manner  and  in
proportional  times:  for  the  case  of the greater  parts  of both systems  and  of
the particles  is the very  same.
   COR.  2. And  if all the  similar  and  similarly  situated  parts  of both  sys
tems  be  at rest among  themselves  ; and  two  of them,  which  are greater  than
the  rest, and mutually  correspondent  in both  systems, begin  to move  in
lines  alike  posited, with  any  similar  motion  whatsoever,  they  will  excite
similar  motions  in the  rest  of the  parts  of the systems,  and  will continue
to move  among  those  parts  in like manner  and  in proportional  times  ; and
will therefore  describe  spaces  proportional  to their  diameters.


       PROPOSITION   XXXIII.   THEOREM   XXVII.

The  same  things  biting supposed,  I say,  that  the  greater  parts  of  the
  systems  are  resisted  in  a  ratio compounded  of the duplicate  ratio  of
   their  velocities, and  the duplicate  ratio of their diameters,  and  Ihe sim
  ple ratio  of the density  of the parts  of the systems.
   For  the resistance  arises  partly from  the centripetal  or centrifugal,  forces
with  which  the  particles  of the system  mutually  act  on  each  other, partly
from  the collisions  and  reflexions  of  the  particles  and   the  greater  parts.
The  resistances  of the  first kind  are  to  each  other  as  the  whole  motive

forces from  which  they  arise, that  is, as the whole  accelerative  forces  and
the  quantities  of matter  in corresponding  parts  ;  that  is  (by the  sup

corresponding  particles  inversely,  and  the quantities  of matter  in  the  cor

quantities  of matter  are  as the  densities  of the parts and  the cubes  of  the
diameters  ; the  resistances  arc  to each  other  as the squares  of the velocities
and  the squares  of the diameters  and  the  densities  of the parts  of  the  sys
tems.  Q.E.D.  The  resistances  of  the  latter  sort  are  as  the  number  of
sorrespondent  reflexions  and  the  forces  of  those  reflexions  conjunctly ; but
the number  of the  reflexions  are  to each  other  as the  velocities  of  the  cor

responding  parts directly  and  the spaces between  their  reflexions  inversely.
And  the  forces  of the  reflexions  are  as  the  velocities  and  the magnitudes
and  the  densities  of the corresponding  parts conjunctly ; that  is, as the  ve
locities and  the cubes  of the diameters  and  the densities  of the parts.  And,
joining  all these  ratios,  the resistances  of  the  corresponding  parts  are  to
each  other  as the squares  of the  velocities  and  the squares  of the diameters
and  the densities  of the parts conjunctly.  Q.E.T).
   COR.  1. Therefore  if those systems  are  two  elastic  fluids, like  our  air,
and  their  parts  are  at rest among  themselves  ; and  two  similar  bodies  pro
portional  in magnitude  and  density  to the  parts  of the  fluids, and  similarly
gituated among  those  parts, be any how  projected  in the direction  of  lines
similarly  posited  ; and  the  accelerative  forces  with which  the  particles  of
the  fluids mutually  act upon  each  other  are  as the diameters  of  the bodies
projected  inversely  and  the squares  of their  velocities  directly ; those  bodies
 will  excite  similar  motions  in the  fluids  in proportional  times, and  will  de
scribe similar  spaces  and  proportional  to  their diameters.
   COR.  2. Therefore  in the same  fluid  a projected  body  that moves  swiftly
meets  with  a resistance  that  is, in the duplicate  ratio  of  its velocity,  nearly.
For  if the  forces  with which  distant  particles  act mutually  upon  one
another  should  be augmented  in  the  duplicate  ratio  of  the  velocity,  the
projected body  would  be resisted  in  the same  duplicate  ratio  accurately  ;
and  therefore  in  a medium,  whose  parts when  at a distance  do  not  act mu
 tually  with  any  force  on  one  another,  the resistance  is in the  duplicate  ra
 tio of the velocity accurately.  Let  there  be, therefore,  three mediums  A,
 B, C, consisting  of similar  and  equal  parts  regularly  disposed  at  equal
 distances.  Let  the  parts  of the mediums  A  and  B  recede  from  each  other
 with  forces  that  are among  themselves  as T  and V ; and  let the  parts  of
 the medium  C  be entirely  destitute  of any  such  forces.  And   if four  equal
 bodies  D, E, P7 G, move  in these mediums,  the two  first D  and  E  in  the
 two  first A and  B, and  the  other  two P  and G  in the  third C ; and  if the
 velocity  of the body D  be  to the velocity  of  the body  E, and  the  velocity
 of the body P  to the velocity  of the body  G, in  the subduplicate  ratio  of
 the force T  to the  force V ; the resistance  of the body D  to the  resistance
 of  the body  E, and  the resistance  of  the body P  to the  resistance  of  the
 body  G, will  be in the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocities  ; and  therefore  the

sistance  of the body E  to the  resistance  of  the body G.  Let  the bodies  1)
and  F  be equally  swift,  as  also the  bodies E  and G ; and, augmenting  the
velocities  of the^bodies D  arid F  in any  ratio, and  diminishing  the  forces
of the  particles  of the medium  B  in  the  duplicate  of  the same  ratio, the
medium  B  will approach  to the form  and  condition  of  the medium  C  at
pleasure  ; and  therefore  the  resistances  of  the  equal  and  equally  swift
bodies  E  and  G  in these mediums  will  perpetually  approach  to equality
so that  their  difference  will  at last become  less than  any  given.  There
fore  since  the resistances  of the bodies D  and F  are  to each  other  as the
resistances  of the bodies E  and  G, those  will  also  in like manner  approach
to the  ratio  of equality.  Therefore  the bodies  1) and  F, when  they move
with  very  great  swiftness, meet  with  resistances  very  nearly  equal;  and
therefore  since  the  resistance  of the body  F  is in a duplicate  ratio  of  the
velocity,  the  resistance  of the body D  will  be nearly  in the same  ratio.
   Con.  3. The  resistance  of a body moving  very  swift  in an  elastic  fluid
is almost  the same  as  if the  parts  of the  fluid were  destitute  of  their  cen
trifugal  forces, and  did  not  fly from  each  other;  if so be that  the  elasti
city of the  fluid  arise from  the centrifugal  forces  of the  particles, and  the
velocity  be  so great  as not  to allow  the particles  time enough  to  act.
   COR.  4. Therefore,  since  the  resistances  of similar  and  equally  swift
bodies,  in  a medium  whose  distant  parts do not  fly from  each  other,  are  as
the squares  of the diameters,  the  resistances made  to bodies moving  with
very  great and  equal  velocities  in an  elastic  fluid  will be as the squares  of
the diameters,  nearly.
   COR.  5. And  since  similar,  equal, and  equally  swift  bodies, moving
through  mediums  of the same  density, whose  particles  do not  fly from  each
other  mutually,  will  strike  against  an equal  quantity  of matter  in  equal
times, whether  the  particles  of which  the medium   consists  be more  and
smaller,  or fewer  and  greater,  and  therefore  impress  on  that matter  an  equal
quantity  of motion,  and  in  return  (by the  3d Law  of Motion)  suffer  an
 equal  re-action  from  the same,  that  is, are  equally  resisted ; it is manifest,
 also, that  in elastic  fluids  of  the same  density, when  the bodies move  with
 extreme  swiftness,  their  resistances  are  nearly  equal, whether  the  fluids
 consist  of gross  parts,  or of parts  ever  so  subtile.  For  the  resistance  of
 projectiles moving  with  exceedingly  great  celerities  is not much  diminished
 by  the subtilty  of the medium.
   COR.  G. All  these  things  are  so in fluids whose  elastic  force  takes  its rise
 from  the centrifugal  forces  of  the particles.  But  if that  force  arise from
 some  other  cause,  as from  the expansion  of the  particles  after  the manner
 of wool,  or the boughs  of  trees, or  any  other  cause, by which  the particles
 are hindered  from  moving  freely among  themselves,  the  resistance, by
 reason  of the  lesser  fluidity  of the medium,  will  be  greater than  in  the
 Corollaries  above.

 If iu a rare  medium,  consisting  of equal  particles  freely  disposed  at
   equal  distances  from  each  other, a  globe  and  a cylinder  described  on
   equal diameters  move  with  equal  velocities  in  the. direction  of  the axis
   of the cylinder,  the resistance  of  the globe  ivill be but  half  so great  an
   that of  the cylinder.
   For  since  the  action  of  the  medi              K
um  upon  the body  is the same  (by                                                                                                                                    L,   P
Cor.  5 of the Laws)  whether  the body
move  in  a  quiescent  medium,   or
whether  the  particles  of  the medium
impinge  with  the same  velocity upon
the  quiescent  body,  let us  consider
the body  as if it were  quiescent,  and
see with  what  force  it would  be im-                             O
pelled by the moving medium.   Let, therefore, ABKI  represent  a spherical
body  described  from  the centre C  with  the  semi-diameter  CA,  and  let the
particles  of  the medium  impinge  with  a given  velocity upon  that  spherical
body  in the directions  of right  lines  parallel  to AC  : and  let FB  be one  of
those  right  lines.  In FB  take LB  equal  to  the  semi-diameter  CB,  and
draw  BI)  touching  the  sphere  in B.  Upon KG  and BD   let fall the  per
pendiculars  BE, LD  ; and  the  force  with  which  a particle  of  the medium,
impinging  on  the  globe  obliquely  in  the  direction  FB, would  strike  the
globe  in B, will be  to the  force  with  which  the same  particle, meeting  the
cylinder ONGQ,  described  about  the globe with  the  axis ACI,  would  strike
it perpendicularly  in b, as LD   to LB,  or BE  to BC.  Again  ; the  efficacy
of this force  to move  the  globe, according  to the  direction  of  its incidence
FB  or AC,  is to the  efficacy of the same  to move  the  globe, according  to
the  direction  of  its determination,  that  is, in the direction  of the right  line
BC   in which  it impels  the  globe  directly,  as BE   to BC.  And,  joining
these  ratios, the  efficacy of  a particle,  falling upon  the globe  obliquely  in
the direction  of the right  line FBy  to move  the globe  in the direction  of its
incidence,  is to the  efficacy of  the same  particle  falling  in the  same  line
perpendicularly  on  the cylinder,  to move  it in the same  direction,  as BE2
to BC3.  Therefore  if in 6E, which   is perpendicular  to the circular  base  of
the  cylinder NAO,  and  equal  to  the  radius  AC,  we  take £H  equal  to

  CASE  1. Let  a cylinder  described  with  the same  diameter  and  altitude  be
conceived  to go forward  with  the same  velocity  in the direction  of  its axis
through  the same  medium  ; and  let us  suppose  that  the  particles  of the
medium,  on  which  the globe  or cylinder  falls, fly back  with  as great  a force
of reflexion  as possible.  Then  since  the  resistance  of the globe  (by the  last
Proposition)  is but  half  the  resistance  of  the cylinder,  and  since  the globe
is to the  cylinder  as 2  to 3, and  since  the cylinder  by falling  perpendicu
larly on  the  particles, and  reflecting them  with  the  utmost  force, commu
nicates  to them  a velocity  double  to  its own;  it follows  that  the  cylinder.
in moving  forward  uniformly  half  the length  of its axis, will communicate
a motion  to  the  particles which  is to the whole  motion  of  the cylinder  as
the density  of the medium  to  the  density  of the  cylinder ; and  that  the
globe,  in the time  it describes  one  length  of  its diameter  in moving  uni
formly  forward,  will communicate   the same  motion  to the particles ; and
in the time  that  it describes  twro  thirds  of  its diameter,  will communicate
a motion  to the  particles which  is to the whole  motion  of  the globe  as  the
density  of the medium   to the  density  of the globe.  Arid  therefore  the
globe  meets  with  a resistance,  which  is to the  force by which  its whole  mo
tion may  be  either  taken  away  or generated  in the  time  in which  it de
scribes  two  thirds  of  its diameter  moving  uniformly  forward,  as the den
sity of  the medium   to the density  of the globe.
   CASE  2. Let  us  suppose  that  the  particles  of the medium  incident  on
the globe  or cylinder  are  not  reflected  ; and  then  the cylinder  falling  per
pendicularly  on  the  particles  will communicate   its own  simple  velocity  to
them,  and  therefore  meets  a  resistance  but  half  so great  as in the former
case, and  the globe  also meets  with  a resistance  but  half  so great.
  CASE  3. Let  us suppose  the  particles  of the medium   to fly back  from
the globe with  a force which  is neither  the  greatest,  nor  yet none  at  all, but
with  a certain  mean  force ; then  the  resistance  of  the globe  will  be in the
same  mean  ratio  between  the resistance  in the  first case  and  the  resistance
in the second.  Q.E.I.

destitute  of  all elastic  force, and  therefore  of  all  force  of  reflexion  ; thf

                      SCHOLIUM.

   I have  exhibited  in this Proposition  the  resistance  and  retardation  of
spherical  projectiles  in mediums  that  are  not  continued,  and  shewn  that
this resistance  is to the  force by which  the whole  motion  of the globe may  be
destroyed  or produced  in the time  in which  the globe  can  describe  two  thirds
of its diameter,  with  a velocity uniformly  continued,  as  the density  of  the
medium   to the density  of the globe,  if so be the globe and  the  particles  of
the medium  be perfectly  elastic, and  are endued  with  the utmost  force  of
reflexion  ; and  that  this  force, where  the globe and  particles  of the medium
are  infinitely  hard  and  void  of any  reflecting  force,  is diminished  one  half.
But  in continued  mediums,  as water,  hot  oil, and  quicksilver,  the globe  as
it passes through  them  does  not immediately  strike  against  all the  parti
cles of the  fluid  that generate  the resistance  made  to  it, but  presses  only
the particles  that  lie next  to  it, which  press  the particles beyond,  which
press  other  particles, and  so  on  ; and  in these mediums  the  resistance  is di
minished  one  other half.  A  globe  in these extremely  fluid mediums  meets
with  a resistance  that  is to the force  by which  its whole  motion  may  be
destroyed  or generated  in the time  wherein  it can  describe, with  that  mo
tion uniformly  continued,  eight  third  parts  of its diameter,  as the  density
of the medium   to the density  of the globe.  This  I shall endeavour  to shew
in what  follows.

the point  I let there  be drawn  the right  line KL   parallel  to the  horizon
and  meeting  the  ice on both  the  sides  thereof  in K  and L.  Then  the  ve
locity  of the water  running  out  at the hole EF  will  be  the same  that  it
would  acquire  by falling from  I through  the  space IG.  Therefore,  by
 Galih'cJ's Theorems,  IG  will  be to IH  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  velo
city of the water  that  runs  out  at the  hole  to the velocity  of the  wrater  in
the  circle AB,  that  is, in the duplicate  ratio  of the  circle AB  to  the  circle
EF  ; those  circles being  reciprocally  as the  velocities  of the  water  which
in the same  time  and  in equal  quantities  passes  severally through  each  of
them,  and  completely  fills them  both.  We  are now  considering  the  velo
city with  which  the water  tends  to the plane  of the horizon.  But  the mo
tion  parallel  to the same, by which  the parts  of the falling water  approach  to
each  other,  is not  here  taken  notice  of; since  it is neither  produced  by
gravity,  nor  at all changes  the motion  perpendicular  to the horizon  which  the
gravity produces.  We  suppose,  indeed,  that  the parts  of the water  cohere
a little, that by their  cohesion  they may  in falling approach  to each  othei
with  motions  parallel  to the horizon  in order  to form  one  single  cataract,
and  to prevent  their being  divided  into  several  : but  the motion  parallel  to
the horizon  arising from  this cohesion  does  not  come  under  our  present
consideration.

  CASE  1. Conceive  now  the  w^hole cavity  in the vessel, wrhich encompasses
the  falling  water ABNFEM,   to be full of  ice, so that  the water  may  pass
through  the  ice as through  a funnel.  Then   if the water  pass  very  near  to
the  ice only, without  touching  it;  or, which  is the same  tiling, if by  rea
son  of the perfect smoothness  of the  surface  of  the  ice, the water, though
touching  it. glides  over  it writh  the utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  le-ast
resistance;  the water  will run  through  the  hole EF  with  the same  velocity
as before,  and  the whole  weight  of the column  of water ABNFEM    will be
all taken  up  as before  in forcing  out  the water,  and  the bottom  of the vessel
will sustain  the weight  of the  ice encompassing  that column.
   Let now  the  ice in the  vessel  dissolve  into  water  ; yet  will the  efflux  of
the water  remain,  as to its  velocity,  the  same  as before.  It  will  not  be
less, because  the  ice now  dissolved  will endeavour  to descend ; it will  not
be greater,  because  the  ice. now  become  water,  cannot  descend  without  hin
dering  the descent  of other  water  equal  to its own  descent.  The  same  force
ought  always  to generate  the same  velocity  in the  effluent  water.
   But  the hole  at the bottom  of  the  vessel, by reason  of the  oblique  mo
tions  of the particles  of the  effluent  water, must  be a little greater  than  before,
For  now  the particles  of the water  do not  all of them  pass  through  the
hole perpendicularly,  but, flowing down  on  all parts from  the  sides  of the
vessel, and  converging  towards  the  hole, pass through  it with  oblique  mo
tions  :  r,r,d in tending downwards  meet  in a stream  whose  diameter  is a little
smaller  below  the  hole  than  at the  hole  itself : its diameter  being  to  the

diameter  of  the hole  as 5 to 6, or  as 5^  to 6|, very  nearly,  if I took  the
measures  of those diameters  right.  I procured  a very  thin  flat plate, hav
ing a hole  pierced  in the middle,  the diameter  of the  circular  hole  being
f parts  of an inch.  And  that  the stream  of running  waters  might  not  be
accelerated  in  falling, and  by that  acceleration  become  narrower,  I fixed
this plate not  to the bottom,  but  to the  side  of the  vessel,  so us to make  the
water  go  out  in the direction  of a line parallel  to the horizon.  Then,  when
the  vessel  was  full of water,  I opened  the hole  to  let  it run  out  ; and  the
diameter  of  the stream, measured  with  great  accuracy  at the  distance  of
about  half  an  inch  from  the  hole, was  f J- of an  inch.  Therefore  the  di
ameter  of this circular  hole  was  to the diameter  of the stream  very  nearly
as 25  to 21.  So  that  the water  in passing  through  the  hole converges  on
all sides, and,  after  it has  run  out  of the  vessel, becomes  smaller  by converg
ing  in that manner,  and  by becoming  smaller  is accelerated  till it comes  to
the  distance  of half  an  inch  from  the  hole, and  at that  distance  flows  in  a
smaller  stream  and  with  greater  celerity than  in the  hole  itself, and  this
in the  ratio  of 25 X  25  to 21  X  21, or 17 to  12, very  nearly ; that  is, in
about  the subdaplicate  ratio  of 2  to 1.  Now   it is certain  from  experiments,
that  the quantity  of water  running  out  in  a given  time  through  a circular
hole made  in the bottom  of a vessel  is equal  to the  quantity,  which,  flow
ing with  the aforesaid  velocity, would  run  out  in the same  time  through
another  circular  hole, whose  diameter  is to the diameter  of the  former   as
21  to 25.  And  therefore  that running  water  in passing  through  the
hole  itself has  a velocity downwards  equal  to  that  which  a heavy  body
would  acquire  in falling through  half  the height  of  the stagnant  water  in
the  vessel, nearly.  But,  then,  after  it has  run  out, it is still accelerated by
converging,  till it arrives  at a distance  from  the  hole  that  is nearly  equal  to
its diameter,  and  acquires  a velocity  greater  than  the  other  in  about  the
subduplicate  ratio  of 2  to 1 ; which  velocity  a heavy  body would  nearly
acquire  by falling through  the whole  height  of the stagnant  water  in  the
vessel.
                           Therefore  in what  follows  let the diameter  of
                                the stream  be represented  by that  lesser  hole which
                             we  called EF.  And  imagine  another  plane VW
                           above  the hole EF,  and  parallel  to the plane  there
                                 of, to be placed  at a distance  equal  to the diame
                                ter of the same  hole, and  to be  pierced  through
                           with  a greater  hole ST,  of such  a magnitude  that
                                      a stream  which  will  exactly  fill the lower  hole EF
                        may  pass through  it ; the diameter  of which  hole
will therefore  be to the diameter  of the lower  hole  as 25  to 21, nearly.  By
this means  the water  will run  perpendicularly  out  at the  lower  hole  ; and
the quantity  of  the water  running  out  will  be, according  to the magnitude

| diameter of | the ho | le as 5 | to 6, or as 5 | ^ to 6|, very | nearly, if | I took the |
| measures of | those | diameter | s right. I | procured a ver | y thin flat | plate, hav |
| ing a hole pi | erced | in the | middle, the | diameter of th | e circular | hole being |
| f parts of an | inch | . And | that the str | eam of running | waters m | ight not be |
| accelerated i | n fal | ling, and | by that a | cceleration be | come narro | wer, I fixed |
| this plate no | t to t | he botto | m, but to th | e side of the ve | ssel, so us | to make the |
| water go out | in th | e directi | on of a line | parallel to the | horizon. | Then, when |
| the vessel wa | s full | of wate | r, I opened | the hole to l | et it run o | ut ; and the |
| diameter of | the s | tream, m | easured wi | th great accur | acy at the | distance of |
| about half a | n inch | from t | he hole, was | f J - o f an inc | h. Theref | ore the di |
| ameter of thi | s cir | cular hol | e was to th | e diameter of t | he stream | very nearly |
| as 25 to 21. | So | that the | water in pa | ssing through | the hole | converges on |
| all sides, and | , after | it has | run out of t | he vessel, become | s smaller | by converg |
| ing in that | manner | , and b | y becoming | smaller is acce | lerated til | l it comes to |
| the distance | of hal | f an inc | h from the | hole, and at th | at distanc | e flows in a |
| smaller stre | am an | d with g | reater celer | ity than in the | hole itse | lf, and this |
| in the ratio | of 25 | X 25 t | o 21 X 21, | or 17 to 12, v | ery nearly | ; that is, in |
| about the su | bdapli | cate rat | io of 2 to 1 | . Now it is cer | tain from | experiments, |
| that the quan | tity | of water | running ou | t in a given t | ime throug | h a circular |
| hole made in | the | bottom o | f a vessel i | s equal to the | quantity, | which, flow |
| ing with the | afore | said vel | ocity, would | run out in th | e same t | ime through |
| another circ | ular h | ole, whos | e diameter | is to the diam | eter of th | e former as |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 21 to 25. | And | therefo | re that run | ning water in | passing | through the |
| hole itself h | as a | velocity | downwards | equal to that | which a | heavy body |
| would acquir | e in | falling t | hrough half | the height of | the stagna | nt water in |
| the vessel, n | early. | But, t | hen, after it | has run out, i | t is still ac | celerated by |
| converging, t | ill it | arrives a | t a distance | from the hole | that is nea | rly equal to |
| its diameter, | and | acquires | a velocity g | reater than th | e other i | n about the |

| acquire by f | alling | through | the whole | height of the s | tagnant w | ater in the |

|  |  |  | Therefore | in what follo | ws let the | diameter of |

334            THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK   11

of this  last hole, the same,  very  nearly, which  the solution  of  the Problem
requires.  The  space included  between  the two  planes  and  the falling stream
may  be considered  as the bottom  of  the vessel.  But,  to make  the solution
more  simple  and  mathematical,  it is better  to take  the lower  plane  alone
for the bottom  of  the  vessel, and  to suppose  that  the water  which  flowed
through  the  ice as through  a funnel,  and  ran  out  of  the  vessel through  the
hole EF  made  in the lower  plane, preserves  its motion  continually,  and  that
the  ice continues  at rest.  Therefore  in what  follows  let ST  be the diame
ter of  a  circular  hole  described  from  the centre  Z, and  let the  stream  run
out  of the  vessel through  that  hole, when  the water  in  the  vessel  is all
fluid.  And  let EP  be the diameter  of  the  hole, which  the stream,  in  fall
ing through,  exactly  fills up, whether  the water  runs  out  of  the vessel by
that upper  hole ST,  or flows  through  the  middle  of  the  ice in the  vessel,
as through  a funnel.  And  let the diameter  of the upper  hole ST  be to the
diameter  of the lower EF   as about  25  to 21, and  let the perpendicular  di&
tance between  the planes  of the holes  be equal  to the diameter  of the  lesser
hole EF.  Then  the velocity  of the water  downwards,  in running  out  of
the  vessel through  the hole ST,  will  be in  that  hole  the same  that  a body
may  acquire  by falling from  half  the  height IZ ; and  the velocity  of both
the  falling streams  will be  in the  hole EF,  the same  which  a body  would
acquire  by falling from  the  Avhole height  IG.
   CASE  2. If the  hole EF  be not  in the middle  of  the bottom  of  the  ves
sel, but  in some  other  part  thereof,  the water  will  still run  out  with  the
same  velocity  as  before,  if the  magnitude  of  the  hole be  the same.  For
though  an heavy  body  takes  a longer  time  in descending  to the same  depth,
by an  oblique  line, than  by a perpendicular  line, yet in both  cases  it acquires
in its descent  the same  velocity ; as Galileo  has  demonstrated.
   CASE  3. The  velocity  of the water  is the same  when  it runs  out through
a hole  in the  side of  the vessel.  For  if the hole  be  small,  so  that  the  in
terval  between  the  superficies AB  and KL  may  vanish  ns  to sense,  and  the
stream  of water  horizontally  issuing  out may  form  a parabolic  figure; from
the  latus rectum  of this parabola may  be collected,  that  the velocity  of the
effluent water  is that which  a body may  acquire  by falling  the height  IG
or HG  of the  stagnant  water  in  the vessel.  For, by making  an  experi
ment,  I found  that  if the height  of the stagnant  water  above  the hole  were
20  inches, and  the height  of the hole  above  a plane  parallel  to the horizon

were  also 20  inches,  a  stream  of water  springing  out  from  thence  wrould
fall upon  the  plane,  at the  distance  of 37  inches,  very  nearly, from  a per
pendicular  let fall upon  that  plane from  the hole.  For  without  resistance
the stream  would  have  fallen  upon  the plane  at  the distance  of 40  inches,
the  latus rectum  of  the parabolic  stream  being 80  inches.
   CASE  4. If  the  effluent  water  tend  upward,  it will  still issue  forth  with
the same  velocity.  For  the  small  stream  of water  springing  upward,  as-

| of this last ho | le, | the same, very | nearly, whic | h the solution of the | Problem |
| requires. The | sp | ace included be | tween the tw | o planes and the falli | ng stream |
| may be consid | ered | as the bottom | of the vess | el. But, to make the | solution |
| more simple | and | mathematical, | it is better | to take the lower pl | ane alone |
| for the bottom | of | the vessel, and | to suppos | e that the water whi | ch flowed |
| through the i | ce as | through a fun | nel, and ran | out of the vessel th | rough the |
| hole EF made | in | the lower plane, | preserves | its motion continually, | and that |
| the ice continu | es | at rest. There | fore in what | follows let ST be t | he diame |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ter of a circu | lar | hole described | from the ce | ntre Z, and let the s | tream run |
| out of the ve | ssel | through that | hole, when | the water in the ve | ssel is all |
| fluid. And l | et E | P be the diame | ter of the | hole, which the stream | , in fall |
| ing through, | exac | tly fills up, wh | ether the w | ater runs out of the | vessel by |
| that upper hol | e S | T, or flows th | rough the | middle of the ice in | the vessel, |
| as through a | funn | el. And let t | he diameter | of the upper hole ST | be to the |
| diameter of th | e l | ower EF as abo | ut 25 to 21, | and let the perpendic | ular di& |
| tance between | the | planes of the | holes be equ | al to the diameter of | the lesser |
| hole EF. Th | en | the velocity of | the water | downwards, in runni | ng out of |
| the vessel thr | ough | the hole ST, | will be in t | hat hole the same th | at a body |
| may acquire b | y f | alling from hal | f the height | IZ ; and the velocit | y of both |
| the falling st | ream | s will be in t | he hole EF, | the same which a bo | dy would |
| acquire by fal | ling | from the Avhol | e height IG | . |  |
| CASE 2. If | the | hole EF be no | t in the mi | ddle of the bottom of | the ves |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sel, but in som | e | other part ther | eof, the wat | er will still run out | with the |
| same velocity | as | before, if the | magnitude | of the hole be the sa | me. For |
| though an hea | vy | body takes a lo | nger time in | descending to the sa | me depth, |
| by an oblique | line | , than by a perp | endicular li | ne, yet in both cases i | t acquires |
| in its descent | the | same velocity ; | as Galileo | has demonstrated. |  |
| CASE 3. Th | e v | elocity of the w | ater is the | same when it runs out | through |
| a hole in the | side | of the vessel. | For if the | hole be small, so th | at the in |
| terval between | th | e superficies AB | and KL | may vanish ns to sense | , and the |
| stream of wate | r h | orizontally issu | ing out may | form a parabolic fig | ure; from |
| the latus rect | um | of this parabola | may be co | llected, that the veloc | ity of the |
| effluent water | is | that which a b | ody may ac | quire by falling the h | eight IG |
| or HG of the | st | agnant water i | n the vessel | . For, by making a | n experi |
| ment, I found | tha | t if the height | of the stag | nant water above the | hole were |
| 20 inches, and | the | height of the | hole above | a plane parallel to th | e horizon |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| were also 20 | inche | s, a stream of | water spr | inging out from then | ce wrould |
| fall upon the | pla | ne, at the dist | ance of 37 | inches, very nearly, fr | om a per |
| pendicular let | fal | l upon that pla | ne from the | hole. For without | resistance |
| the stream wo | uld | have fallen up | on the plan | e at the distance of | 40 inches, |
| the latus rect | um | of the paraboli | c stream be | ing 80 inches. |  |

cends  with  a perpendicular  motion  to GH   or GI, the height  of the stagnant
water  in the  vessel ; excepting  in so far  as  its ascent  is hindered  a little by
the resistance  of the  air  : and  therefore  it springs  out with  the  same  ve
locity that  it would  acquire  in falling from  that height.  Every  particle  of
the stagnant  water  is equally  pressed  on  all sides  (by Prop. XIX.,  Book   II),
and, yielding  to the  pressure,  tends  always  with  an  equal  force, whether  it
descends  through  the hole  in the bottom  of  the  vessel, or  gushes  out  in an
horizontal  direction  through  a hole  in the  side, or passes  into  a canal, and
springs up from  thence  through  a little hole made  in the upper  part  of the
canal.  And   it may  not  only be  collected  from  reasoning,  but  is manifest
also from  the well-known  experiments  just mentioned,  that  the  velocity
with which  the water  runs  out  is the very same  that  is assigned  in this
Proposition.
  CASE  5. The  velocity  of  the  effluent  water  is the  same,  whether  the
figure of  the  hole  be circular,  or  square,  or triangular,  or any  other  figure-
equal  to the circular ; for the velocity  of the  effluent water  does  not depend
upon  the  figure of  the  hole, but  arises from  its depth  below  the  plane
KL.
                           CASE  6.  If the lower  part  of the vessel ABDC
                       B  be immersed  into  stagnant  water,  and  the height
                                of the stagnant  water  above  the bottom  of  the ves
                                 sel be GR,  the velocity  with which  the water  that
                                  is in the  vessel  will run  out  at the hole EF  into
                           the  stagnant  water  will  be  the  same  which  the
                            water  would  acquire  by falling  from  the height
                         IR ; for  the weight  of  all the water  in the  vessel
                              that  is below  the  superficies  of the stagnant  water
will be sustained  in  equilibrio  by  the weight  of  the  stagnant  water,  and
therefore  does  riot at  all accelerate  the  motion  of  the descending  water  in
the vessel.  This  case  will  also appear  by experiments,  measuring  the  times
in which  the water  will run  out.

   COR.  1. Hence  if CA  the  depth  of  the water  be produced  to K, so  that
AK  may  be to CK  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  area  of a hole made  in any
part  of the bottom  to the area  of the  circle AB,  the velocity  of the  effluent
water  will be equal  to the  velocity which  the water  would  acquire  by falling
from  the height KC.
   COR.  2. And  the force  with which  the whole  motion  of  the effluent  watei
may  be generated  is equal  to  the weight  of  a cylindric  column  of  waterr
whose  base  is the hole EF,  and  its altitude 2GI  or 2CK.   For  the  effluent
water,  in the time  it becomes  equal  to this column, may  acquire, by falling
by  its own  weight  from  the height  GI,  a velocity  equal  to that  with  which
it runs  out.

   COR.  3. The  weigb  t of  all the water  in the  vessel ABDC   is to that  part

of the weight  which  is employed  in forcing  out  the water  as the sum  of
 the  circles AB  and EF  to twice  the  circle EF.   For  let IO  be  a mean  pro
portional  between  IH  and  IG, and  the water  running  out  at the hole EF
will, in the time  that  a drop  falling from  I would  describe  the  altitude  IG,
become  equal  to  a cylinder whose  base  is the  circle EF  and  its  altitude
2IG;  that  is, to  a cylinder whose  base  is the  circle AB,  and  whose  altitude
is 2IO.  For  the  circle EF   is to the  circle AB  in the subduplicate  ratio  cf
the  altitude IH  to the altitude IG ; that  is, in the simple  ratio  of the mean
proportional  IO  to the  altitude IG.  Moreover,  in  the  time  that  a drop
falling from  I can  describe  the  altitude  IH,  the water  that  runs  out  will
hare become  equal  to  a cylinder whose  base  is the  circle AB,  and  its  alti

scribes HG,  the  difference  of the  altitudes,  the  effluent  water,  that  is, the
water  contained  within  the  solid ABNFEM,   will  be equal  to the  difference
of the  cylinders,  that  is, to  a cylinder whose  base  is AB,  and  its altitude
2HO.  And  therefore  all the water  contained  in the  vessel ABDC   is to the
whole  falling water  contained  in the  said  solid ABNFEM   as HG  to2HO,
that  is, as HO  +  OG   to 2HO,  or IH  + K  ) to 2IH.  But  the weight  of  all
the water  in the  solid ABNFEM   is employed  in forcing  out  the water   ;
and  therefore  the weight  of  all  the water  in the vessel  is to  that  part  of
the weight  that  is employed  in forcing  out  the water  as IH  +  IO  to 2IH,
and  therefore  as the sum  of the  circles EF  and AB   to twice  the  circle
EF.
   COR.  4. And  hence  the weight  of  all the water  in  the vessel ABDC    is
to the other  part of  the weight  which  is sustained  by the  bottom  of  the
vessel  as the sum  of the  circles AB  and EF   to the  difference  of  the  same
circles.
   COR.  5. And  that  part  of the weight  which  the bottom  of the  vessel  sus
tains  is to the  other  part of  the weight  employed  in forcing  out  the water
as the  difference  of the  circles AB  and EF  to twice  the  lesser  circle EF,  or
as the  area  of the bottom  to twice  the  hole.
   COR.  6. That  part  of the weight  which  presses upon  the bottom  is to
the whole  weight  of  the water  perpendicularly  incumbent  thereon  as  the
circle AB  to the sum  of the  circles AB  and  EF,  or  as the  circle AB   to thf
excess  of  twice  the  circle AB  above  the  area  of the bottom.  For  that part
of the weight  which  presses upon  the bottom  is to the weight  of  the whole
water  in the  vessel  as the  difference  of the  circles AB  and EF  to the sum
of  the same  circles  (by Cor.  4) ; and  the weight  of the whole  water  in  the

may  tend  to  a concave  figure.  And  as the congealed  water AMEC,  BNFD,
lying round  the  cataract,  is convex  in  its internal  superficies AME,  BNF,
towards  the  falling  cataract,  so  this column PHQ   will  be convex  towards
the cataract  also, and  will therefore  be greater than  a  cone  whose  base  is
that  little  circle PQ  and  its altitude GH;  that  is, greater  than  a  third
part  of a cylinder  described  with  the same  base  and  altitude.  Now  that
little  circle sustains  the weight  of  this column,  that  is, a weight  greater
than  the weight  of the  cone,  or  a third  part  of the cylinder.
   COR.  8. The  weight  of water  which  the  circle PQ;  when  very  small,  sus
tains, seems  to be  less than  the weight  of two  thirds  of a cylinder  of water
whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  its altitude HG.   For, things standing
as above  supposed,  imagine  the  half  of a spheroid  described  whose  base  id
that  little  circle, and  its semi-axis  or  altitude HG.   This  figure  will  be
equal  to two  thirds  of that  cylinder, and  will comprehend  within  it  the
column  of congealed  water PHQ,  the weight  of which  is sustained  by that
little circle.  For  though  the motion  of  the water  tends  directly down
wards,  the  external  superficies  of  that column  must  yet meet  the base PQ
in an  angle somewhat  acute, because  the water  in  its fall  is perpetually  ac
celerated,  and  by reason  of that  acceleration  become  narrower.  Therefore,
oince  that  angle  is less than  a right  one, this column  in  the  lower  parts
thereof  will  lie within  the hemi-spheroid.  In  the upper  parts  also  it will be
acute  or pointed;  because  to make  it otherwise,  the  horizontal  motion  of
 the water  must  be at the vertex  infinitely more  swift  than  its motion  to
 wards  the horizon.  And  the  less this  circle PQ   is, the more  acute  will                                     22

the vertex  of this column  be ; and  the  circle being diminished  in infinitn/n
the angle PHQ   will  be diminished  in  infinitum,  and  therefore  the  co

that hemi-spheroid,  or than  two-third  parts  of  the cylinder  whose  base  is
that  little  circle, and  its altitude GH.  Now  the  little  circle  sustains  a
force  of water  equal  to the weight  of this column,  the weight  of the ambient
water  being employed  in causing  its efflux  out  at the  hole.
   COR.  9. The  weight  of water  which  the  little  circle PQ   sustains, when
it is very  small,  is very  nearly  equal  to the weight  of  a  cylinder  of water
whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  its altitude |GH  • for  this weight  is an
arithmetical  mean  between  the weights  of the cone  and  the hemi-spheroid
above mentioned.  But  if that  little  circle be  not  very  small, but  on  the
contrary  increased  till it be equal  to the hole EF,  it will sustain  the weight
of all the water  lying  perpendicularly  above  it, that  is, the weight  of  a
cylinder  of water  whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  its altitude GH.
   COR.  10.  Arid  (as far  as  I can judge)  the weight  which  this  little  circle
sustains  is always  to the weight  of a cylinder  of water  whose  base  is that
little  circle, and  its altitude iGH,  as EF2   to EF2  —  |PQ2,  or  as the  cir

nearly.

If a cylinder  move  uniformly  forward   in. the direction  of its length,  the
   resistance  made  thereto  is  not  at  all changed  by augmenting   or di
   minishing-  that  length  ; and  is therefore  the same  with  the resistance
   of a  circle, described  with  the same  diameter,  and  moving  forward
   with  the same  velocity  in  the  direction,  of a right  line perpendicular   to
    its plane.
   For  the  sides  are  not  at  all opposed  to the motion  ; and  a cylinder  be
comes   a circle when  its length  is diminished  in infinitum.

       PROPOSITION   XXXVII.   THEOREM  XXIX.

If a cylinder  move  uninformly  forward  in  a  compressed,  infinite,  arid
   non-elastic  finid,  in  the direction  of  its length,  the  resistance  arising
  from  the magnitude  of its transverse  section  is to the force  by which
   its whole  motion may  be destroyed  or  generated,  in  the  time  that  it
   moves  four  times  its length,  as  the density  of the medium   to the  den
   sity of the cylinder,  nearly.
   For  let the  vessel ABDC   touch  the surface  of stagnant  water  with   its
bottom  CD,  and  let the water  run  out  of  this  vessel  into  the stagnant  wa
ter through  the cylindric  canal EFTS  perpendicular  co the  horizon  ; and
 let the  little  circle PQ,  be placed  parallel  to the  horizon  any  where  in the

EF  above  the  little  circle PQ  bears  to  the  cir
cle AB.  Then  it is manifest  (by Case  5, Case             e
6, and  Cor.  1, Prop. XXXVI)   that  the velocity
of the water  passing  through  the annular  space
between  the  little  circle and  the  sides  of the  ves
sel will be  the very  same  which  the water  would
acquire  by falling, and  in  its fall describing  the
altitude KG  or IG.
  And  (by Cor.  10, Prop. XXXVI)   if the breadth  of the  vessel  be  infinite,
so that  the  lineola HI  may  vanish,  arid the altitudes  IG, HG  become  equal  ;
the  force  of the water  that  flows down  and  presses  upon  the  circle  will  be
to the weight  of  a cylinder  whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  the  altitude
iIG,  as EF2   to EF2  —  |PQ2,  very nearly.  For  the  force  of the  water
flowing downward  uniformly  through  the  whole  canal  will  be the  same
upon  the  little  circle PQ.  in whatsoever  part  of the canal  it be placed.
    I ,et now  the  orifices  of the canal EF, ST  be  closed, and  let  the  littk
circle ascend  in the  fluid compressed  on  every  side, and  by its ascent  let  it
oblige  the water  that  lies above  it to descend  through  the  annular  space
between  the  little  circle and  the  sides  of the canal.  Then  will  the velocity
of the ascending  little  circle  be  to the velocity  of  the  descending  water  as
the  difference  of the  circles EF  and  PQ,  is to the  circle PQ;  and  the  ve
locity  of the ascending  little  circle  will  be  to the sum  of the velocities,  that
is, to the  relative  velocity  of the descending  water  with  which  it passes by
the  little  circle  in  its ascent,  as the  difference  of the  circles EF  and PQ   to

the  circle EF,  or  as EF*  —  PQ2  to EF2.  Let  that  relative  velocity  be
equal  to the velocity  with  v/hich  it was  shewn  above  that  the water  would
 pass through  the annular  space,  if the  circle were  to remain  unmoved,  that
 is, to the velocity  which  the water  would  acquire  by falling, and  in  its fall
 describing  the altitude  IG  ; and  the  force  of the water  upon  the ascending-
 circle  will be the same  as before  (by Cor.  5, of the Laws  of Motion)  ; that
 is, the resistance  of the ascending  little  circle  will be  to  the weight  of  a
 cylinder  of water  whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  its altitude  iIG,  as
EF2   to EF2  —  iPQ2,  nearly.  But  the velocity  of  the  little  circle  will
 be to the velocity  which  the water  acquires  by falling, and  in  its fall de
 scribing  the altitude  [G, as EF2  —  PQ2  to EF2.
   Let  the breadth  of the canal  be increased  in wfinitum  ; and  the  ratios
 between  EF2  —  PQ2  and  EF2,  and  between  EF2  and EF2  —  iPQ2.
 will become  at last  ratios  of equality.  And  therefore  the  velocity  of  the

 equal  to the weight  of  a cylinder  whose  base  is that  little  circle, and  its
 altitude  half  the  altitude  IG, from  which  the cylinder  must  fall  to acquire
 the velocity  of the ascending  circle ; and  with  this velocity  the cylinder  in
 the time  of its fall will  describe  four  times  its length.  But  the resistance
 of the  cylinder moving  forward  with  this  velocity  in the direction  of  its
 length  is the same  with  the  resistance  of the  little circle (by Lem.  IV), and
 is therefore  nearly  equal  to the  force by which  its motion  may  be generated
 while  it describes  four  times  its length.
   If  the length  of the  cylinder  be augmented  or  diminished,  its motion,
 and  the time  in which  it describes  four  times  its length,O twill  be augmented&
or diminished  in the same  ratio, and  therefore  the  force by which  the mo
 tion  so increased  or diminished,  may  be destroyed  or  generated,  will  con
tinue  the  same  ; because  the  time  is increased  or diminished  in  the  same
proportion  ; and  therefore  that  force remains  still equal  to the  resistance
of  the  cylinder,  because  (by Lem.  IV) that  resistance  will  also remain  the
same.
   If  the density  of  the cylinder  be augmented  or diminished,  its motion,
and  the  force by which  its motion  may  be  generated  or destroyed  in the
same  time,  will be augmented  or diminished  in the same  ratio.  Therefore
the resistance  of  any  cylinder  whatsoever  will  be  to the  force by which  its
whole  motion  may  be generated  or destroyed,  in the time  during  which  it
moves  four  times  its length,  as the density  of the medium   to the  density  of
the cylinder- nearly.  Q..E.D.
  A  fluid  must  be compressed  to become  continued;  it must  be continued
and  non-elastic,  that  all the pressure  arising from  its compression  may  be
propagated  in an  instant  ; and  so, acting  equally upon  all parts  of the body
moved,  may  produce  no  change  of  the  resistance.  The  pressure  arising
from  the motion  of the  body  is spent  in generating  a motion  in the parts
of the  fluid, and  this creates  the resistance.  But  the pressure  arising from
the compression  of the  fluid, be  it ever  so forcible,  if it be propagated  in an
instant,  generates  no motion  in the parts of  a continued  fluid, produces  no
change  at all of motion  therein  ; and  therefore  neither  augments  nor  les
sens  the  resistance.  This  is certain,  that  the  action  of  the fluid  arising
from  the compression  cannot  be  stronger  on  the hinder  parts  of  the body
moved  than  on  its fore  parts, and  therefore  cannot  lessen  the  resistance  de
scribed  in  this proposition.  And  if  its propagation  be  infinitely  swifter
than  the motion  of  the body  pressed,  it will  not  be stronger  on  the  fore
parts  than  on  the  hinder  parts.  But  that  action  will  be  infinitely
swifter, and  propagated  in an  instant,  if the  fluid  be continued  and  non-
elastic.

| of the cylinder | movin | g forward w | ith | this velocity | in the direct | ion of its |

| and the force by | whic | h its motio | n m | ay be genera | ted or destro | yed in the |

| A fluid must | be co | mpressed to | bec | ome continue | d; it must be | continued |

                      SCHOLIUM.

   In  this proposition  we  have  investigated  that  resistance  alone  which
arises from  the magnitude  of  the  transverse  section  of  the  cylinder,  neg
lecting  that  part of  the same  which  may  arise from  the  obliquity  of  the
motions.  For  as, in Case  1, of  Prop. XXXVL,   the  obliquity  of  the mo
tions  with  which  the  parts of  the water  in  the vessel  converged  on  every
side  to the hole EF  hindered  the  efflux of  the water  through  the  hole,  so,
in  this Proposition,  the  obliquity  of  the motions,  with  which  the parts  of
the water,  pressed by the antecedent  extremity  of the cylinder,  yield  to the
pressure,  and  diverge  on  all sides, retards  their passage  through  the  places
that  lie round  that  antecedent  extremity,  toward  the  hinder  parts of  the
cylinder,  and  causes  the  fluid  to be moved  to  a greater  distance;  which  in
creases  the  resistance,  and  that  in the same  ratio  almost  in which  it dimin
ished  the  efflux  of the water  out  of the  vessel, that  is, in the duplicate  ratio
of 25  to 21, nearly.  And  as, in Case  1, of  that Proposition,  we  made  the
parts of  the water  pass  through  the  hole EF  perpendicularly  and  in  the
greatest  plenty, by supposing  all  the water  in the vessel  lying  round  the
cataract  to be frozen,  and  that  part  of the water  whose  motion  was  oblique,
and  useless  to  remain  without  motion,  so  in  this  Proposition,  that  the
 obliquity  of  the motions  may  be  taken  away,  and  the  parts of  the water
may  give  the  freest passage  to the  cylinder, by yielding  to it witli  the most
 direct  and  quick motion  possible,  so that  only  so much  resistance  may  re-

main  as  arises from  the magnitude  of  the transverse  section, and  which  is
incapable  of diminution,  unless  by diminishing  the diameter  of the cylinder ;
we  must  conceive  those  parts  of  the  fluid whose  motions  are  oblique  and
useless, and  produce  resistance,  to be  at rest among  themselves  at both  ex
tremities  of the cylinder, and  there  to cohere, and  be joined  to the  cylinder.
Let ABCD   be  a  rectangle,  and  let
AE  and BE  be  two  parabolic arcs,               i                1
described  with  the  axis AB, and  g         j^
with  a latus rectum  that  is to the    .----""'
space HG,  which  must  be described
by the  cylinder  in falling, in  order
to acquire  the velocity with  which  it moves,  as HG   to ^AB.  Let CF  and
DF  be two  other  parabolic  arcs  described  with  the  axis CD,  and  a latus
rectum  quadruple  of the former;  and  by the  convolution  of the  figure
about  the  axis EF  let there  be generated  a solid, whose  middle  part ABDC
is the cylinder  we  are here speaking  of, and  whose  extreme  parts ABE  and
CDF  contain  the parts  of the  fluid  at rest among  themselves,  and  concreted
into two  hard  bodies, adhering  to the cylinder  at each  end  like a head  and
tail. Then  if this solid EACFDB   move  in the direction  of the length  of
its axis FE  toward  the  parts  beyond  E, the  resistance  will be  the same
which  we have  here determined  in this Proposition,  nearly ; that  is, it will
have  the same  ratio  to the force with  which  the whole  motion  of  the cyl
inder may  be destroyed  or  generated,  in the time  that  it is describing  the
length 4AC  with  that  motion  uniformly  continued,  as the density  of the
fluid has  to  the  density  of the  cylinder, nearly. And  (by Cor.  7, Prop.
XXXVI)   the resistance  must  be to this force  in the ratio  of 2 to 3, at the
least.

                    LEMMA   V.

If a cylinder,  a sphere, and  a spheroid,  of equal  breadths  be placed  suc
   cessively  in  the middle  of  a cylindric  canal,  so  that  their  axes  may
   coincide  with  the axis  of the canal,  these  bodies  will equally  hinder  t^e
  passage  of the water  through  the canal.
   For  the  spaces  lying between  the  sides of  the  canal, and  the  cylinder,
sphere, and  spheroid, through  which  the water  passes,  are  equal ; and  the
water  will  pass  equally  through  equal  spaces.
   This  is  true, upon  the supposition  that  all the water  above  the cylinder,
sphere,  or spheroid,  whose  fluidity  is not  necessary  to make  the passage  of
the water  the quickest  possible,  is congealed,  as was  explained  above  in Cer
7, Prop. XXXVI.

                    LEMMA    VI.

The  same  supposition  remaining,  the fore- mentioned  bodies  are  equally
             acted  OIL by the water  Jlowin g through  the canal.
  This  appears  by Lein. V and  the  third  Law.    For  tht water  and  the
bodies  act upon  each  other  mutually  and  equally.

                   LEMMA   VIL

If the water  be at  rest in  the canal, and  these  bodies  move  with  equil  ve
   locity and  the contrary  way  through  the  canal,  their  resistances  will
   be equal among  themselves.
   This  appears  from  the  last Lemma,  for the  relative  motions  remain  the
same  among  themselves.

                     SCHOLIUM.

  The  case  is the same  of all convex  and  round  bodies, whose  axes  coincide
with  the axis  of  the canal.  Some  difference  may  arise from  a greater  or
less friction;  but  in these Lemmata  we  suppose  the  bodies  to be perfectly
smooth,  and  the medium   to be void  of  all tenacity  and  friction  ; and  that
those  parts  of the  fluid which  by their  oblique  and superfluous  motions  may
disturb,  hinder,  and  retard  the  flux of  the water  through  the  canal,  are  at
rest amorg  themselves ; being  fixed  like water  by  frost, and  adhering  to
the  fore and  hinder  parts  of the  bodies  in  the manner  explained  in the
Scholium  of the  last Proposition  : for  in what  follows  we  consider  the very
least resistance  that round  bodies  described  with  the greatest  given  trans
verse  sections  can  possibly  meet  with.
   Bodies swimming  upon  fluids, when  they move  straight  forward,  cause
 the  fluid  to ascend  at their  fore parts  and  subside  at  their  hinder  parts,
especially  if they  are  of an  obtuse  figure ; and  thence  they meet  with  a
 little more  resistance  than  if they were  acu*-e  at  the head  and  tail.  And
 bodies moving  in elastic  fluids,  if they  are  obtuse  behind  and  before,  con
dense  the  fluid  a little more  at  their  fore  parts, and  relax  the same  at theii
 hinder  parts ; and  therefore  meet  also with  a little more  resistance  than  ii
 they were  acute  at  the head  and  tail.  But  in these Lemmas  and Proposi
 tions  we  are  not treating  of  elastic  but  non-elastic  fluids;  not  of  bodies
 floating  on  the  surface  of  the  fluid, but  deeply immersed  therein.  And
 when  the  resistance  of  bodies  in non-elastic  fluids  is once known,  we  may
 then augment  this  resistance  a little in elastic  fluids, as  our  air; and  in
 the surfaces  of stagnating  fluids,  as lakes  and  seas.

  may  be destroyed  or generated,  in the time  that  it describes  eight  third
  parts  of its diameter,  as  the density  of the fluid  to the  density  of  the
   globe, very  nearly.
   For  the globe  is to  its circumscribed  cylinder  as two  to three ; and  there
fore  the  force which  can  destroy  all the motion  of the  cylinder, while  the
same  cylinder  is describing  the length  of four  of its diameters,  will destroy
all the motion  of the  globe, while  the globe  is describing  two  thirds  of this
length,  that  is, eight  third  parts  of  its own  diameter.  Now  the resistance
of the cylinder  is to this  force  very  nearly  as the density  of the fluid  to the
density  of the cylinder  or globe  (by Prop. XXXVII),  and  the resistance  of
the globe  is equal  to  the  resistance  of  the  cylinder  (by Lem.  V, VI, and
VII).  Q.E.D.
   COR.  I. The  resistances  of globes  in infinite compressed  mediums  are in
a ratio compounded  of the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity, and  the  dupli
cate  ratio  of the diameter,  and  the  ratio  of the density  of the mediums.
   COR.  2. The  greatest  velocity, with  which  a globe  can  descend  by  its
comparative  weight  through  a resisting  fluid, is the same  which  it may
acquire  by falling  with  the same  weight,  and  without  any  resistance,  and
in  its fall describing  a space  that  is, to four  third  parts  of  its diameter  as
the density  of the globe  to the density  of  the fluid.  For  the globe  in the
time  of its fall, moving  with  the velocity  acquired  in falling,  will  describe
a space  that  will be  to eight  third  parts  of  its diameter  as the  density  of
the globe  to the density  of the  fluid  ; and  the  force  of  its weight  which
generates  this motion  will  be  to the  force  that  can  generate  the  same  mo
tion,  in the time  that  the globe  describes  eight  third  parts  of its diameter,
with  the same  velocity  as the  density  of  the  fluid  to  the  density  of  the
globe;  and  therefore  (by this Proposition)  the force  of weight  will  be equal
to the  force  of resistance,  and  therefore  cannot  accelerate  the globe.
   COR.  3.  If there  be given  both  the density  of  the globe and  its velocity
at the beginning  of the motion,  and  the density  of the compressed  quiescent
fluid  in which  the globe moves,  there  is given  at any time  both  the  velo
city of the globe and  its resistance,  and  the space  described  by it (by Cor.
7, Prop. XXXV).
   COR.  4. A globe moving  in  a compressed  quiescent  fluid  of the  same
density  with  itself will  lose half  its motion  before  it can describe  the length
of two  of its diameters  (by the same  Cor.  7).

       PROPOSITION  XXXIX.   THEOREM  XXXI.

 If a  S'lobe move  uniformly  forward  through  a fluid  inclosed  and  com
  pressed  in  a cylindric  canal,  its resistance  is to the force  by which  its

   describes  eight  third  parts  of its dia?netert  in  a  ratio compounded  of

| For the glo | be is to it | s circumscribe | d cylinder | as two | to three ; | and there |
| fore the force | which can | destroy all | the motion | of the | cylinder, | while the |

| all the motion | of the glo | be, while the | globe is | describin | g two thir | ds of this |

| of the cylinde | r is to this | force very n | early as t | he densit | y of the fl | uid to the |
| density of the | cylinder | or globe (by | Prop. XXXV | II), a | nd the res | istance of |

   half  the greatest  circle of  the globe ; and  the duplicate  ratio  of  the
   orifice of the  canal,  to the excess  of that  orifice above  the greatest  circle
   of the globe  ; and  t/ie ratio  of the density  of the fluid  to the density  of
   the globe, nearly.
   This  appears  by Cor.  2, Prop. XXXVII,  and  the demonstration  pro
ceeds  in the same  manner  as in the foregoing  Proposition.

                     SCHOLIUM.

   In the  last two  Propositions  we  suppose  (as was  done  before  in Lem.  V)
that  all the water  which  precedes  the  globe, and  whose  fluidity  increases
the resistance  of the same,  is congealed.  Now   if that water  becomes  fluid,
it will somewhat  increase  the resistance.  But  in  these  Propositions  that
increase  is so small, that  it may  be  neglected,  because  the convex  superfi
cies  of the globe produces  the very same  effect almost  as  the  congelation
of the  water.

           PROPOSITION   XL.   PROBLEM   IX.

To find  by phenomena  the resistance  of a globe moving  through  a per
                        fectly fluid compressed  medium.
   Let A  be the weight  of the globe  in vacua,  B  its weight  in the  resisting
medium,  D  the diameter  of the globe. F  a space which  is to f D  as the den
sity of the globe  to the density  of the medium,  that  is, as A  to A —  B, G
the time  in which  the globe  falling with  the weight  B without  resistance
describes  the space P, and H  the velocity  which  the body  acquires  by that
fall.  Then  H  will  be the greatest  velocity  with  which  the globe  can  pos
sibly descend  with  the weight  B  in the resisting medium,  by Cor.  2, Prop
XXXVIII  ; and  the resistance  which  the globe  meets  with, when  descend
ing with  that  velocity,  will be equal  to its weight B ; and  the resistance  it
meets  with  in any  other  velocity  will  be  to the weight B  in the duplicate  ra
tio of that  velocity  to the greatest  velocity  H, by Cor.  1, Prop. XXXVIII.
   This  is the resistance  that  arises from  the  inactivity  of the  matter  of
the fluid.  That  resistance  which  arises from  the  elasticity,  tenacity, and
friction  of its parts, may  be thus  investigated.
   Let  the  globe be  let fall so that  it may  descend  in the  fluid by the weight
B  ; and  let P  be the time  of falling, and  let that  time  be expressed  in sec
onds,  if the time G  be given  in seconds.  Find  the  absolute  number  N                                       2P

jj=      H, and  the  height  described  will be -^        1 .38629430 IIP  +
4,6051701S6LF.      If the  fluid  be  of  a sufficient  depth,  we  may  neglect  the
                       2PF
term  4,6051 70186LF;  and —  r- —  1,3362943611F  will  be  the  altitude

described, nearly.  These  things  appear  by Prop.  IX, Book  II, and  its Corol
laries, and  are  true  upon  this supposition,  that  the globe meets  with  no  other
resistance  but  that which  arises from  the inactivity  of matter.  Now  if it
really meet  with  any  resistance  of another  kind,  the descent  will  be slower,
and  from  the quantity  of that  retardation  will be known  the  quantity  of
this new  resistance.
  That  the velocity  and  descent  of a body  falling in a  fluid might  more
easily  be known,  I have  composed  the following  table ; the  first column  of
which  denotes  the times  of  descent  ; the  second  shews  the  velocities  ac
quired  in falling,  the greatest  velocity  being 100000000:   the  third  exhib
its the spaces  described  by falling  in those  times, 2F  being  the  space which
the body  describes  in the time  G  with  the  greatest  velocity  ; and  the fourth
gives  the spaces  described  with  the  greatest2P    velocity  in  the same  times.

The  numbers  in the fourth  column  are -pn and  by subducting  the number
 1,3962944 —  4,60517021,,  are found  the numbers  in  the  third  column  ;
and  these numbers  must  be multiplied  by the space F  to obtain  the spaces
 described  in falling.  A  fifth column  is added  to all  these, containing  the
spaces  described  in the same  times  by a body  falling in  vacno  with  the
 force  of B  its comparative  weight,

                                                                                                                                                       \
                     SCHOLIUM*

   In order  to investigate  the resistances  of  lluids from  experiments,  I pro
cured  a square  wooden  vessel, whose  length  and  breadth  on  the  inside  was
9 inches English  measure,  and  its depth  9 feet \ ; this I filled with  rain
water:  and  having  provided  globes made  up  of wax, and  lead  included
therein,  I noted  the times  of the descents  of these  globes,  the height through
which  they descended  being  112  inches.  A  solid  cubic  foot  of English
measure  contains  76 pounds  troy weight  of  rain  water  ; and  a  solid  inch
contains  if  ounces  troy weight,  or  253  ' grains:  and  a  globe  of water  of
one  inch  in diameter  contains  132,645  grains  in  air, or 132,8  grains  in
vacn.o  ; and  any  other  globe  will  be  as  the  excess  of  its weight  in vacuo
above  its weight  in water.
  EXPER.  1. A  globe whose  weight  was  156^  grains  in  air, and  77  grains
in water, described  the whole  height  of 1 12 inches  in 4 seconds.  And, upon
repeating  the  experiment,  the globe  spent  again  the very  same  time  of 4
seconds  in falling.
  The  weight  of  this globe  in vacuo  is 156^1  grains;  and  the  excess  of
this weight  above  the weight  of the globe  in water  is 79^ f grains.  Hence
the diameter  of the globe appears  to be 0,84224  parts  of an inch.  Then  it
will  be, as that  excess  to the weight  of the globe  in vacuo,  so is the density
of the water  to the density  of  the globe;  and  so is f parts  of the diameter
of  the globe  (viz. 2,24597  inches)  to the  space 2F, which  will  be therefore
4.4256  inches.  Now   a globe  falling  in  vacuo  with  its whole  weight  of
156^f  grains  in one  second  of  time  will describe  193|  inches  ; and  falling
in water  in the same  time  with  the weight  of 77 grains without  resistance,

will  describe  95,219  inches'; and  in  the time  G, which  is to one  second  of
time  in the subduplicate  ratio  of the space  P, or  of 2,2128  inches  to 95,219
inches,  will  describe  2,2128  inches, and  will acquire  the greatest  velocity H
with  which  it is capable  of descending  in water.  Therefore  the time  G  is

0",15244.  And  in  this time  G, with  that  greatest  velocity H, the  globe
will describe  the space 2F,  which  is 4,4256  inches;  and  therefore  in 4 sec
onds  will describe  a space  of 1 16,1245  inches.  Subduct  the space 1,3862944  F,
or 3,0676  inches, and  there  will remain  a space  of 113,0569  inches, which
the globe  falling through  water  in  a very  wide  vessel  will describe  in 4 sec
onds.  But  this  space, by reason  of  the narrowness  of  the wooden  vessel
before  mentioned,  ought  to be diminished  in  a ratio compounded  of the  sub-
duplicate  ratio  of the  orifice  of the  vessel  to the  excess  of this  orifice above
half  a great  circle of  the  globe, and  of  the simple  ratio  of the same  orifice
to its excess  above  a  great  circle of  the  globe, that  is, in a ratio of  1 to
0,9914.  This  done, we  have  a space  of 112,08  inches, which  a globe  fall
ing  through  the water  in  this wooden  vessel  in 4 seconds  of time  ought
nearly  to describe  by this theory;  but  it described  112  inches  by the  ex
periment.

348           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    II

   EXPER.  2. Three  equal  globes, whose  weights  were  severally  76^- grains
 in air, and  5T^  grains  in water, were  let  fall successively -; and  every  one
 fell through  the water  in 15 seconds  of time, describing  in  its fall a height
 of 112  inches.

   By  computation,  the weight  of  each  globe  in vacuo  is 76T52 grains ; the
 excess  of this weight  above  the weight  in water  is 71  grains  £ J ; the diam
 eter of  the globe 0,81296  of an  inch;  f parts  of  this  diameter  2,1 67S£
 inches;  the  space 2F  is 2,3217  inches;  the  space  which  a globe  of  5T\
 grains  in weight would  describe  in one  second  without  resistance,  12,80'
 inches,  and  the  time G0",301056.  Therefore  the  globe, with  the greatest
 velocity  it is capable  of  receiving  from  a weight  of 5^  grains  in  its de

 scent  through  water,  will describe  in the  time  0",3L)1056the  space  of 2,3217
inches;  and  in 15 seconds  the  space 115,678  inches.  Subduct  the  space
 1,3862944F,  or 1,609  inches, and  there  remains  the space 114.069  inches,
which  therefore  the falling globe ought  to describe  in the same  time,  if the
vessel  were  very wide.  But  because  our  vessel was  narrow,  the space  ought
 to be diminished  by about  0,895  of an inch.  And  so  the  space  will remain
 113,174  inches, which  a  globe  falling  in  this vessel ought  nearly  to de
scribe  in 15  seconds, by the theory.  But  by  the experiment  it described
112 inches.  The  difference  is riot sensible.
   EXPER.  3. Three  equal  globes, whose  weights  were  severally  121  grains
in  air, and  1  grain  in  water,  were  successively  let  fall ; and  they  fell

through  the water  in  the  times  46", 47", and  50", describing  a height  oi
112  inches.

   By  the theory,  these  globes ought  to have  fallen  in  about  40".  Now
whether  their  falling more  slowly  were  occasioned  from  hence,  that  in slow
 motions  the resistance  arising from  the  force  of inactivity  does  really  bear
a less proportion  to  the  resistance  arising from  other  causes  ; or whether
it is to be  attributed  to little bubbles  that  might  chance  to  stick  to the
globes,  or to  the  rarefaction  of  the wax  by the warmth  of  the weather,  or
of  the hand  that  let them  fall ; or, lastly, whether  it proceeded  from  some
insensible  errors  in weighing  the  globes  in  the water,  I am  not  certain.
Therefore  the weight  of the globe  in water  should  be  of several  grains, that
the experiment  may  be certain, and  to be depended  on.
  EXPER.  4.  I began  the foregoing  experiments  to investigate  the  resistan
ces  of  fluids, before  I was  acquainted  with  the  theory  laid down  in  the
Propositions  immediately  preceding.  Afterward,  in order  to examine  the
theory  after  it was  discovered,  I procured  a wooden   vessel, whose  breadth
on  the  inside  was  Sf inches, and  its depth   ] 5 feet and  -i. Then  I made
four  globes  of wax,  with  lead  included,  each  of which  weighed  139 1 grains
in air, and  7\ grains  in water.  These  I let fall, measuring  the times  of their
falling  in  the water  with  a pendulum  oscillating  to half  seconds.  The
globes were  cold, and  had  remained  so some  time, both when  they were

 .reighed  and when  they were  let fall ; because  warmth  rarefies  the wax.  and
by rarefying  it diminishes  the weight  of  the globe  in the water  ; and  wax,
when  rarefied,  is not  instantly  reduced  by cold  to its former  density.  Be
fore they were  let fall, they were  totally immersed  under  water,  lest, by the
weight  of any  part  of them  that might  chance  to be above  the water,  their
descent  should  be  accelerated  in its beginning.  Then, when  after  their
immersion  they were  perfectly  at  rest, they were  let go with  the  greatest
care, that  they might  not  receive  any impulse  from  the hand  that  let them
down.  And  they  fell successively  in the times  of 47 J, 48^,  50, and  51  os
cillations, describing  a height  of  15  feet and  2 inches.  But  the weather
was  now  a little colder  than  when  the globes  were  weighed,  and  therefore  1
repeated  the experiment  another  day ; and  then  the globes  fell in the times
of 49, 49i,  50. and 53;  and  at  a  third  trial  in the  times  of 49£,  50, 51.
and  53  oscillations.  And  by making  the experiment  several  times  over, I
found  that  the globes  fell mostly  in  the  times  of 49|  and  50  oscillations.
When  they  fell slower,  I suspect  them  to have  been  retarded  by striking
against  the  sides  of the  vessel.
  Now, computing  from  the  theory,  the weight  of  the globe  in vacno  is
139|  grains;  the  excess  of  this weight  above  the weight  of  the globe  in
water 132|i  grains ; the diameter  of the globe 0,99868  of an inch :  |- parts
of  the  diameter  2,66315  inches;  the  space 2F  2,8066  inches;  the  space
which  a globe weighing  7| grains  falling without  resistance  describes  in  a
second  of time  9,88164  inches;  and  the  time G0",376843  Therefore  the
globe with  the  greatest  velocity  with which  it is capable  of descending
through  the water  by the  force  of  a weight  of 7} grains,  will  in the  time
0",376843  describe  a  space  of 2,8066  inches, and  in one  second  of time  a
space  of 7,44766  inches, and  in the time  25", or in 50  oscillations,  the space
186,1915  inches.  Subduct  the  space  1,386294F,  or  1,9454  inches,  and
there  will remain  the  space 184,2461  inches  which  the globe  will  describe
in that  time  in  a very  wide  vessel.  Because  our  vessel  was  narrow,  let this
space  be diminished  in  a ratio compounded  of the subduplicate  ratio  of the
orifice  of the  vessel  to the  excess  of  this  orifice above  half  a great  circle  of
the  globe, and  of the simple  ratio  of  the  same  orifice  to its excess  above  a
great  circle of the  globe ; and  we  shall have  the  space  of  181,86  inches,
which  the globe ought  by the theory  to  describe  in this vessel  in the time
of 50  oscillations, nearly.  But  it described  the  space  of  182  inches, by
experiment,  in 49^  or 50  oscillations.
   EXPER.  5. Pour  globes weighing  154|  grains  in air, and  21 1 grains  in
water,  being  let fall several  times,  fell in the times  of 28^,  29, 29 £, and  30,
and  sometimes  of 31, 32, and  33  oscillations,  describing  a height  of 15 feet
and  2  inches.
   They  ought  by the theory  to have  fallen  in the time  of 29  oscillations,
 nearly.

  EXPER.  6. Five  globes, weighing  212f  grains  in air, and 79^  in water,
being  several  times  let fall, fell in the  times  of 15, 15^,  16, 17, and  18  os
cillations,  describing  a height  of 15  feet and  2  inches.
  By  the theory  they ought  to have  fallen  in the time  cf 15  oscillations,
nearly.
  EXPER.  7. Four  globes, weighing  293  f grains  in air, and  35|  grains  in
water, being  let fall several  times,  fell in the times  of 29±  30, 301  31, 32,
and  33  oscillations,  describing  a height  of 15  feet and  1 inch  and  £.
  By  the theory  they ought  to have  fallen  in the time  of 28  oscillations,
nearly.
   In searching  for the  cause  that  occasioned  these globes  of the same  weight
and magnitude  to  fall, some  swifter  and  some  slower,  I hit upon  this ; that
the  globes, when  they were  first  let go  and  began  to fall, oscillated  about
their centres;  that  side which  chanced  to be the  heavier  descending   first,
and  producing  an  oscillating motion.  Now  by oscillating  thus, the  globe
communicates   a greater  motion  to the water  than  if  it descended  without
any  oscillations  ; and  by this communication   loses part of  its own  motion
with  which  it should  descend  ; and  therefore  as  this  oscillation  is greater
or  less, it will  be more  or less retarded.  Besides,  the globe  always  recedes
from  that  side of  itself which  is descending  in  the  oscillation,  and  by  so
receding  comes  nearer  to the  sides  of the  vessel,  so  as even  to strike  against
them  sometimes.  And  the heavier  the  globes  are, the stronger  this  oscil
lation  is ; and  the  greater  they  are, the  more  is the water  agitated  by  it.
Therefore  to diminish  this  oscillation  of  the  globes,  1 made  new  ones  of
lead  and  wax,  sticking  the  lead  in one  side of  the globe  very  near  its sur
face;  and   I. let fall the  globe  in such  a manner,  that,  as near  as  possible,
the heavier  side might  be lowest  at the beginning  of  the descent.  By  this
means  the  oscillations  became  much  less than  before, and  the times  in which
 the globes  fell were  not  so unequal:  as in the following  experiments.
   EXPER.  8. Four  globes weighing  139  grains  in  air, and  6|  in water,

inches.
   By  the theory  they ought  to fall in about  the time  of 52  oscillations
   EXPER.  9. Four  globes weighing  273^  grains  in  air, and  140£  in water,

   These  globes by the  theory ought  to have  fallen  in the time  of  1 1 } os

| communicates | a greater mo | tion to the | water than | if it | descen | ded without |

of 19  oscillations,  I sometimes  heard  them  hit against  the  sides  of  tl.e ves
sel before  they reached  the bottom.
  By  the theory  they ought  to have  fallen  in the time  of 15f  oscillations,
nearly.
  EXPER.  11. Three  equal  globes, weighing  48 grains  in the  air, and  3||
in water, being  several  times  let fall, fell in the times  of  43J,  44, 44 1, 45,
and  46  oscillations, and  mostly  in 44  and  45. describing  a height  of 182*
inches,  nearly.
  By  the theory  they ought  to have  fallen  in the time  of  46  oscillations
and  f, nearly.
  EXPER.  12. Three  equal  globes, weighing  141  grains  in  air, and 4|  in
water, being  let fall  several  times,  fell in the  times  of  61, 62, 63, 64, and
65  oscillations,  describing  a space  of 182  inches.
  And  by  the  theory  they ought  to have  fallen  in  641  oscillations
nearly.
  From  these experiments  it is manifest,  that when  the globes  fell slowly,
as in  the  second,  fourth,  fifth, eighth,  eleventh, and  twelfth  experiments;

the  times  of  falling  are  rightly  exhibited  by the  theory  • but when  the
globes  fell more  swiftly,  as in the  sixth, ninth,  and  tenth  experiments,  the
resistance  was  somewhat  greater  than  in the duplicate  ratio  of the velocity.
For  the globes  in  falling  oscillate  a little  : and  this  oscillation,  in  those
globes  that  are  light and  fall slowly, soon  ceases by  the weakness  of  the
motion  ; but  in greater  and  heavier  globes, the motion  being  strong,  it con
tinues  longer,  and  is not  to be checked  by the ambient  water  till after  sev
eral oscillations  Besides,  the  more  swiftly  the globes  move,  the  less  are
they pressed by the  fluid  at  their hinder  parts;  and  if the velocity  be. per
petually  increased,  they  will  at  last  leave  an  empty  space  behind  them,
unless  the compression  of the  fluid  be increased  at the same  time.  For  the
compression  of the  fluid ought  to be  increased  (by Prop. XXXII   and
XXXIII)  in the duplicate  ratio  of the  velocity,  in order  to preserve  the  re
sistance  in the same  duplicate  ratio.  But  because  this  is not  done,  the
globes  that move  swiftly  are  not  so much  pressed  at  their hinder  parts  as
 the others;  and  by the  defect  of  this  pressure  it comes  to pass  that  their
 resistance  is a little greater  than  in a duplicate  ratio  of  their  velocity.
   So  that  the theory  agrees  with  the phenomena   of bodies  falling  in water
 It remains  that  we  examine  the phenomena   of bodies  falling  in  air.

   But  the times  observed  must  be corrected  ; for the globes  of mercury  (by
 Galileo's  theory),  in 4 seconds  of time, will  describe  257 English  feet, and
220  feet in only 3"42'".  So  that  the wooden  table, when  the pin was  taken
out, did not  turn  upon  its hinges  so quickly  as it ought  to have  done;  and
the slowness  of that  revolution  hindered  the descent  of the  globes  at the
beginning.  For  the globes  lay about  the middle  of  the  table, and  indeed
were  rather  nearer  to the  axis upon  which  it turned  than  to the pin.  And

hence  the times  of falling were  prolonged  about  18'"; and  therefore  ought
to be corrected  by subducting  that  excess,  especially  in the larger  globes,
which,  by reason  of  the largeness  of  their  diameters,  lay longer  upon  the
revolving  table  than  the others.  This  being  done,  the times  in which  the

   Therefore  the  fifth in order among  the globes  that  were  full of air being

5 inches  in diameter,  and  483  grains  in weight,  fell in 8"  12'", describing  a
space  of 220  feet.  The  weight  of  a bulk  of water  equal  to this globe  is
1 6600  grains;  and  the weight  of an equal bulk  of air is l||f-  grains,  or  I9r3o
grains ; and  therefore  the weight  of the globe  in vacuo  is 502T3?r grains;
and  this weight  is to the weight  of a bulk  of  air equal  to  the globe  as
502T;v  to  19T3o- ; and  so is 2P  to | of the diameter  of the globe,  that  is, to

vacuo  with  its whole  weight  of 502T3¥  grains, will  in one  second  of time
describe  193|  inches  as above  ; and  with  the weight  of 483  grains  will de

   EXPER.  14. Anno  1719,  in the month  of July,  Dr. Desaguliers  made

some  experiments  of this kind  again, by forming  hogs' bladders  into spheri
cal orbs ; which  was  done  by means  of  a concave  wooden  sphere, which  the
bladders,  being  wetted  well  first, were  put into.  After  that  being  blown
full  of  air. they were  obliged  to  fill up  the spherical  cavity  that  contained
them  ; and  then, when  dry, were  taken  out.  These  were  let fall from  the
lantern  on  the top  of the cupola  of the same  church,  namely,  from  a height
of 272  feet ; and  at the same  moment   of time  there was  let  fall a leaden
globe, whose  weight  was  about  2 pounds  troy weight.  And  in  the mean
time  some  persons  standing  in  the  upper  part  of  the church  where  the
globes  were  let fall observed  the whole  times  of falling  ; and  others  stand
ing on  the ground  observed  the  differences  of the  times  between  the  fall
of the leaden  weight  and  the  fall of the bladder.  The  times  were  measured
by pendulums  oscillating  to half seconds.  And  one  of those  that  stood
upon  the ground  had  a machine  vibrating  four  times  in one  second  ; and
another  had  another  machine  accurately  made  with  a pendulum  vibrating
four  times  in  a second  also.  One  of those  also who  stood  at the top  of the
church  had  a like machine  ; and  these instruments  were  so contrived,  that
their motions  could  be stopped  or  renewed  at pleasure. Now  the  leaden
globe  fell in about  four  seconds  and  i of time;  and  from  the  addition  of
this time  to the difference  of time  above  spoken  of, was  collected  the \Vhole
time  in which  the bladder  was  falling.  The  times  which  the  five bladders

spent  in falling,  after  the leaden  globe  had  reached  the  ground,  were,  tn*e
first time,  14£", 12f, 14f , 17 f, and  16J-" ; and  the second  time,  14i",  14}",
14", 19", and  16 J".  Add  to these  4£", the time  in which  the  leaden  globe
was  falling, and  the whole  times  in which  the  five bladders  fell were,  the

first fane, 19*  17", 18J",  22", and 21}";  and  the  second  time, 18f,  18i",

the  first time, 19 f", 17f', 18f,  22f', and  21f";  and  the  second  time,  19",
ISf", ISf,  24". and 211".  But  the bladders  did  not  always  fall  directly
down,  but sometimes  fluttered  a little in the  air, and  waved  to and  fro, aa

were  prolonged,  and  increased  by half  a second  sometimes,  and  sometimes
by  a whole  second.  The  second  and  fourth  bladder  fell most  directly  the
first time, and  the  first and  third  the second  time.  The  fifth bladder  was
wrinkled,  and  by  its wrinkles  was  a little retarded.  I found  their diame
ters by their circumferences  measured  with  a very  fine thread wound  about
them  twice.  In the following  table  I have  compared  the experiments  with
the theory  ; making  the density  of air  to be  to the density  of rain-water  as
1 to 860, and computing  the  spaces  which  by the theory  the  globes ought

   Our  theory,  therefore,  exhibits  rightly,19"    within  a  very  little, all  the  re
sistance  that  globes moving  either  in air or in water  meet  with  ; which^ap-
pears  to be proportional  to the densities  of the  fluids  in globes  of equal  ve
locities and  magnitudes.
   In the Scholium  subjoined  to  the  sixth  Section,  we  shewed,  by experi
ments  of pendulums,  that  the resistances  of equal  and  equally  swift  globes
moving  in  air, water,  and  quicksilver,  are  as the  densities  of  the  fluids.
We  here  prove  the same  more  accurately  by experiments  of  bodies  falling
in air and water.  For  pendulums  at each  oscillation  excite  a motion  in
the  fluid always  contrary  to the motion  of the pendulum  in its return   : and
the  resistance  arising from  this motion,  as  also  the resistance  of the thread
by which  the pendulum   is suspended,  makes  the whole  resistance  of a pen
dulum  greater  than  the  resistance  deduced  from  the experiments  of falling
bodies.  For  by the experiments  of pendulums  described  in that Scholium,
a globe  of the same  density  as water  in describing  the length  of  its semi-
diameter  in  air would  lose  the  -3^-0  part  of  its motion.  But  by  the
theory  delivered  in this seventh  Section,  and  confirmed  by experiments  of
falling  bodies, the same  globe  in describing  the same  length would  lose only
a part  of its motion  equal  to  j-Vir? supposing  the  density  of water  to be
to the density  of air as  8r>0  to 1.  Therefore  the  resistances  were  found
greater by the experiments  of pendulums  (for the  reasons  just mentioned)
than  by the experiments  of falling  globes  ; and  that  in the ratio  of about
4 to 3.  Bat  yet since  the resistances  of pendulums  oscillating  in air, wa
ter, and  quicksilver,  are  alike  increased  by like  causes,  the  proportion  of
the resistances  in these mediums  will be  rightly enough  exhibited  by th«

experiments  of pendulums,  as  well  as by the experiments  of falling  bodies.
And  from  all this  it may  be concluded,  that  the resistances  of bodies, moving
 in any  fluids whatsoever,  though  of the most  extreme  fluidity,  are,  cceteris
paribus,  as the  densities  of the  fluids.
   These  things being  thus  established,  we  may  now  determine  what  part
of its motion  any  globe  projected  in any  fluid whatsoever  would  nearly  lose
in  a given time.  Let D  be the diameter  of the  globe, and  V  its velocity
at the beginning  of its motion,  and T  the time  in which  a globe  with  the
velocity V  can  describe  in  vacua  a space  that  is, to  the  space |D  as the
density  of the globe  to the density  of  the  fluid  ; and  the  globe*V     projected

in that  fluid  will,  in  any  other   time  t lose  the  part  ™1    -p   t, the  part
  TV
r»    remaining  ; and  will describe  a space, which  will  be  to  that  de

scribed  in the same  time  in, vacua  with  the  uniform   velocity  V, as  the
                      T  +  t
logarithm  of the number  — ~ —  multiplied  by  the number  2,302585093  is

to the number  7^, by Cor.  7, Prop. XXXV.   In  slow  motions  the  resist

ance may  be a little  less, because  the figure of  a globe  is more  adapted  to
motion  than  the figure  of  a cylinder  described  with  the same  diameter.  In
swift motions  the  resistance may  be a little greater, because  the  elasticity
and  compression  of the  fluid  do  not increase  in the  duplicate  ratio  of  the
velocity.  But  these  little niceties  I take  no  notice  of.
  And  though  air. water,  quicksilver, and  the  like  fluids, by the  division
of their  parts  in infinitum,  should  be  subtilized,  and become  mediums  in
finitely  fluid, nevertheless,  the  resistance  they would  make  to  projected
globes would  be the same.  For  the  resistance  considered  in the preceding
Propositions  arises from  the inactivity  of  the matter;  and  the  inactivity
of matter  is essential  to  bodies,  and  always  proportional  to  the  quantity
of matter.  By  the division  of  the parts  of  the  fluid  the resistance  arising
from  the tenacity  and  friction  of the  parts may  be indeed  diminished  : but
the quantity  of  matter  will not  be  at  all diminished  by  this division  ; and
if the quantity  of matter  be  the  same,  its force of  inactivity  will  be  the
same  ; and  therefore  the  resistance  here spoken  of will be the  sanue,  as being
always  proportional  to that force.  To  diminish  this  resistance,  the quan
tity of matter  in the spaces  through  which  the bodies  move  must  be dimin
ished  ; and  therefore  the  celestial  spaces, through  which  the  globes  of  the
planets  and  comets  are  perpetually  passing  towards  all  parts, with  the
utmost  freedom,  and  without  the  least  sensible  diminution  of their motion,
must  be  utterly  void  of  any  corporeal  fluid, excepting,  perhaps, some  ex
 tremely  rare  vapours  and  the  rays  of light.

| ance may be a | little less, bec | ause the | figure of | a globe is more a | dapted to |

356           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BoOK    11.

   Projectiles  excite  a motion  in fluids  as they  pass through  them,  and  this
motion  arises from  the  excess  of the  pressure  of  the  fluid  at the  fore parts
of  the projectile above  the  pressure  of  the same  at the hinder  parts  : and
cannot  be  less in mediums  infinitely  fluid than  it is in air, water,  and quick
silver, in proportion  to the density  of matter  in each.  Now  this excess  of
pressure  does, in proportion  to its quantity,  not  only  excite  a motion  in the
fluid, but  also  acts upon  the  projectile  so  as  to retard  its motion  ; and  there
fore  the  resistance  in every  fluid  is as the motion  excited  by the  projectile
in the  fluid ; and  cannot  be less in the most  subtile  aether  in proportion  to
the density  of  that  aether, than  it is in  air, water,  and  Quicksilver,  in pro
portion  to the  densities  of  those  fluids.

                Of  motion  propagated  through  fluids.

        PROPOSITION   XLI.   THEOREM   XXXII.

A pressure  is not propagated  through  a fluid  in  rectilinear  directions
         unless  ichere  the particles  of  the fluid  lie in  a right  line.
                          If the  particles  a, b} c, d, e, lie in  a right  line, the  pres
                     sure may  be indeed  directly propagated  from  a  to  e ; but
                   then  the  particle  e will  urge  the  obliquely  posited  parti
                      te) cles / and  g  obliquely,  and  those  particles /  and  g  will
                    not  sustain  this  pressure,  unless  they  be supported  by the
                    particles  h and  k  lying beyond  them ; but  the  particles
that support  them  are  also  pressed  by them  ; and  those  particles cannot
sustain  that  pressure,  without  being supported  by, and  pressing  upon,  those
particles  that  lie still farther,  as / and  m,  and  so on  in itiflnitum.  There
fore  the  pressure,  as  soon  as  it is propagated  to  particles  that  lie out  of
right  lines, begins  to deflect  towards  one  hand  and  the  other, and  will be
propagated  obliquely  in infinitum  ; and  after  it has begun  to be propagat

ed obliquely,  if 'it reaches  more  distant  particles  lying  out  of  the right
line, it will  deflect again  on  each hand  and  this  it will  do  as  often  as it
lights  on  particles  that  do not  lie exactly  in  a right line.  Q.E.D.
  COR.  If any  part  of  a pressure,  propagated  through  a fluid from  a given
point, be intercepted  by any  obstacle,  the remaining  part, which  is not  in
tercepted,  will  deflect  into  the  spaces behind  the obstacle.  This may  be
demonstrated  also  after  the following manner.  Let  a pressure  be propagat
ed from  the point A  towards  any  part, and, if  it be possible,  in rectilinear

NO,  on  each  hand,  as towards  the  rare  intervals  between  the pulses ; and
thence  the  medium,  becoming  always  more  rare  next  the  intervals,  and
more  dense  next  the  pulses,  will partake  of their motion.  And  because  the
progressive  motion  of the pulses  arises from  the perpetual  relaxation  of the
den?er  parts towards  the antecedentrnre  intervals;  and  since  the pulses  will
relax  themselves  on  each  hand  towards  the quiescent  parts of  the medium
KL,  NO,  with  very  near  the same  celerity ; therefore  the pulses  will  dilate
themselves  on  all sides  into  the unmoved  parts KL,  NO,  with  almost  the

from A  through  the hole BC.  Then  since  the cause  of this propagation  is
that  the parts  of the medium  that  are  near  the  centre  A  disturb  and  agitate
those which  lie farther  from  it; and  since  the  parts which  are  urged  are
fluid, and  therefore  recede  every  way  towards  those  spaces  where  they  are

as  to those  right  before,  as PQ, ; and  by  this means  all the motion,  as soon

        PROPOSITION   XLIII.   THEOREM  XXXIV.

Every  tremulous  body  in an  elastic medium  propagates  the motion  of
   the pulses  on  every  side  right forward  ; but  in  a non-elastic medium
   excites  a circular  motion.

   CASE.  1. The  parts  of the tremulous  body, alternately  going  and  return
ing, do  in going  urge  and  drive  before  them  those  parts  of the medium  that
lie nearest,  and by that  impulse  compress  and  condense  Nthem  ; and  in  re
turning  suffer  those  compressed  parts  to  recede  again, and  expand  them
selves.  Therefore  the parts  of the medium  that  lie nearest  to the tremulous
body move  to and  fro by turns,  in like manner   as the parts  of the tremulous
body  itself do ; and  for the same  cause  that  the  parts  of  this body  agitate
these  parts  of the medium,  these  parts, being  agitated  by like tremors,  will
in their turn  agitate  others  next  to themselves  ; and  these  others, agitated
in like manner,  will agitate  those  that  lie beyond  them,  and  so on  in, infin-
itum.  And  in  the same  manner  as  the  lirst parts of  the medium  were
condensed  in  going, and  relaxed  in  returning,  so will  the  other  parts  be
condensed  every  time  they  go, and  expand  themselves  every  time  they  re
turn.  And  therefore  they  will not be  all going  and  all returning  at the
same  instant  (for in that  case  they would  always  preserve  determined  dis
tances from  each  other, and  there  could  be  no  alternate  condensation  and
rarefaction)  ; but  since, in the  places where  they  are  condensed,  they ap
proach  to, and, in the places where  they  are  rarefied, recede  from  each  other,
therefore  some  of them  will  be going  while  others  are returning  ; and  so  on
in infinitum.  The  parts  so going, and  in their going  condensed,  are  pulses,
by reason  of the  progressive  motion  with  which  they strike  obstacles  in
their way;  and  therefore  the  successive  pulses  produced  by a tremulous
body  will  be propagated  in rectilinear  directions  ; and  that  at nearly  equal
distances  from  each  other, because  of  the equal  intervals  of  time  in which
the body, by  its several  tremors  produces  the  several  pulses.  And  though
the parts of  the tremulous  body go  and  return  .n some  certain  and  deter
minate  direction,  yet the pulses propagated  from  thence  through  the medium

 will  dilate  themselves  towards  the  sides, by the foregoing  Proposition  : anc7

 will be propagated  on  all sides from  that  tremulous  body,  as from  a com

 of  this we  have  in waves  excited  by shaking  a  finger  in water,  which
proceed  not  only forward  and  backward  agreeably  to  the  motion  of  the
finger, but spread  themselves  in the manner   of concentrical  circles  all round
 the  finger, and  are propagated  on  every  side.  For  the gravity  of the water
supplies  the place  of elastic  force.

body,  the motion  will  be propagated  in an  instant  towards  the  parts where
the medium  yields most  easily, that  is; to the  parts which  the  tremulous
body  would  otherwise  leave vacuous  behind  it.  The  case  is the same  with
that of  a body  projected  in  any medium  whatever.  A medium  yielding
to projectiles  does  not  recede  in infinitum,  but with  a circular  motion  comes
round  to the spaces which  the  body  leaves  behind  it.  Therefore  as often
as a tremulous  body  tends  to  any  part, the medium  yielding  to it comes
round  in  a circle  to the  parts which  the  body  leaves  ; and  as often  as the
body  returns  to the  first place, the medium  will  be driven  from  the place  it
came  round  to, and  return  to its original place.  And  though  the tremulous
bod}  be not  firm  and  hard, but  every  way  flexible, yet if  it continue  of  a
given  magnitude,  since  it cannot  impel  the medium  by its  treniors  any
where  without  yielding  to  it somewhere   else, the medium  receding  from  the
parts  of the body  where  it is pressed  will always  come  round  in  a circle  to
the parts  that  yield  to it.  Q.E.D.
   COR.  It is a mistake,  therefore,  to  think,  as some  have  done, that  the
agitation  of the parts  of flame  conduces  to the propagation  of a pressure  in
rectilinear  directions  through  an  ambient  medium.  A  pressure  of  that
kind  must  be derived  not from  the agitation  only  of the parts  of flame, but
from  the dilatation  of the whole.

        PROPOSITION   XL1V.   THEOREM  XXXV.

 If water  ascend  a/id descend  alternately  in  the erected  legs KL,  MN,  of
   a canal  or pipe  ; and  a pendulum   be constructed  whose  length  between
    the point  of suspension  and  the  centre  of oscillation  is equal  to half
   the length  of the ivater  in  the canal ; I say, that  the water  will ascend
   and  descend  in  the same  times  in which  the pendulum   oscillates.

   I measure  the length  of the water  along  the axes  of the canal  and  its legs,
and  make   it equal  to the  sum  of  those  axes;  and  take  no  notice  of  the
resistance  of  the water  arising from  its attrition  by the  sides  of  the  canal.
Let,  therefore, AB,  CD,  represent  the mean  height  of the water  in both
legs ; and when  the water  in  the  leg KL  ascends  to the  height EF,  the
water  will descend  in the leg MN   to the height GH.   Let  P be  a pendulou/

| Case 2. If th | e medium | be n | ot elastic, | then, because its parts | cannot be |

| the medium yie | lds most | easily | , that is; t | o the parts which the | tremulous |
| body would oth | erwise leav | e va | cuous behin | d it. The case is the | same with |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that of a body | projected | in a | ny medium | whatever. A medium | yielding |
| to projectiles do | es not rece | de in | infinitum, | but with a circular mot | ion comes |
| round to the sp | aces which | the | body leave | s behind it. Therefor | e as often |
| as a tremulous | body tends | to | any part, | the medium yielding t | o it comes |
| round in a circl | e to the p | arts | which the | body leaves ; and as of | ten as the |
| body returns to | the first p | lace, | the medium | will be driven from t | he place it |
| came round to, | and return | to its | original p | lace. And though the | tremulous |
| bod} be not fir | m and hard, | but | every way | flexible, yet if it cont | inue of a |

the pendulum  describes, P  its lowest  point, PQ  an  arc  equal  to the neight
AE.  The  force with  which  the  motion  of the water  is accelerated  and  re

tarded  alternately  is the  excess  of the weight  of the water  in one  leg above
the weight  in  the  other;  and,  therefore, when  the water  in  the  leg KL
ascends  to EF,  and  in  the  other  leg descends  to GH,  that  force  is double
the weight  of the water EABF,  and  therefore  is to  the weight  of the whole
water  as AE  or PQ,  to VP  or PR.  The  force  also with  which  the body P
is accelerated  or retarded  in any  place,  as Q,  of a cycloid,  is (by Cor. Prop.
LI)  to its whole  weight  as its distance  PQ, from  the lowest  place P  to  the
length PR  of  the cycloid.  Therefore  the  motive  forces  of  the water  and
pendulum,  describing  the  equal  spaces AE,  PQ,  are  as  the weights  to  be
moved  ; and  therefore  if the water  and pendulum  are  quiescent  at  first,
those  forces  will move  them  in equal  times, and  will cause  them  to go  and
return  together  with  a reciprocal motion.  Q.E.D.

 and  in the time  that  the pendulum  will  perform  one  single  oscillation  the
 waves  will advance  forward  nearly  a space  equal  to their  breadth.
   That  which  I call the  breadth  of  the waves  is the  transverse  measure

                                                    lying between  the  deepest
                                  —   part  of the hollows,  or the
                                                   tops  of the ridges.  Let
ABCDEF   represent  the surface  of stagnant  water  ascending  and  descend
ing  in  successive  waves  ; and  let A, C, E, &c., be  the  tops of  the waves  ;
and  let B, D, F, &c., be  the intermediate  hollows.  Because  the motion  of
the waves  is carried  on by the successive  ascent  and  descent  of  the  water,
so that  the  parts  thereof,  as A, C, E, &c., which  are highest  at one  time
become  lowest  immediately  after ; and  because  the  motive  force, by which
the highest  parts descend  and  the lowest  ascend,  is the weight  of the  eleva
ted water,  that  alternate  ascent  and  descent  will  be analogous  to the recip
rocal motion  of the water  in the  canal, and  observe  the same  laws  as to the
times  of  its ascent  and  descent;  and  therefore  (by Prop. XLIV)   if the
distances  between  the  highest  places  of  the waves  A, C, E, and  the lowest
B, D, F, be equal  to  twice  the length  of any  pendulum,  the highest  parts
A, C, E, will  become  the lowest  in the time  of  one  oscillation,  and  in  the
time  of another  oscillation  will ascend again.  Therefore  between  the  pas
sage  of each  wave,  the time  of  two  oscillations  will intervene ; that  is, the
wave  will  describe  its breadth  in  the  time  that pendulum  will  oscillate
twice;  but  a pendulum  of  four  times  that  length, and  which  therefore  is
equal  to the  breadth  of  the waves,  will just  oscillate  once  in  that  time.
Q.E.L
   COR.  1. Therefore  waves,  whose  breadth  is equal  to 37\ French   feet,
will advance  through  a space  equal  to their breadth  in one  second  of time;
and  therefore  in one  minute  will go  over  a space  of 1S3J  feet ; and  in an
hour  a space  of 11000  feet, nearly.
   COR.  2. And  the velocity  of greater  or less waves  will be augmented   or
diminished  in the subduplicatc  ratio  of their  breadth.
  These  things  are  true upon  the supposition  that  the parts  of water  as
cend  or descend  in  a right line;  but, in  truth,  that  ascent  and  descent  is
rather  performed  in  a circle  ; and  therefore  I propose  the  time  denned  by
this Proposition  as only  near  the  truth.

PS  the perpendicular HL   or hi, and  there
be taken  E£  equal  to PL  or PI, the physi
cal point E may  be found  in e.  A  point,
as E, moving  acccording  to this law  with
a reciprocal  motion,  in  its going  from E
through  e to  e, and  returning  again through
e to E, will perform  its several  vibrations  with  the same  de
grees  of acceleration  and  retardation  with  those  of an  oscil
lating pendulum.  We  are now  to  prove  that  the  several
physical  points  of the medium   will  be agitated  with  such  a
kind  of motion.  Let  us suppose,  then, that  a medium  hath
such  a motion  excited  in  it from  any  cause  whatsoever,  and
consider  what  will  follow  from  thence.
   In the circumference PHSA   let there  be taken  the  equal
arcs, HI, IK,  or hi, ik, having  the same  ratio  to  the whole
circumference  as the equal  right  lines EF, FG  have  to BC,
the whole  interval  of  the pulses.  Let  fall the perpendicu

successively  agitated  with  like motions,  and  perform  their  en tire vibrations
composed  of their going  and  return,  while  the pulse  is transferred  from B
to C ; if PH  or PHS/t  be the time  elapsed  since  the beginning  of the mo

beginning  of the motion  of the point  F, and PK  or PHSA;  the time  elapsed
since  the beginning  of the motion  of the  point G;  and  therefore  Ee, F0,

for the same  reason  the  difference  of the  elastic  forces  of the physical  points

ference  (that  is, the  excess  of the  elastic  force  of  the  point  e above  the
elastic  force  of the point  y) is the very  force by which  the intervening  phy
sical lineola  ey  of the medium   is accelerated  in going,  and  retarded  in  re
turning  ; and  therefore  the accelerative  force  of the  physical  lineola  ey  is
as its distance  from  ft, the middle  place  of the vibration.  Therefore  (by
Prop. XXXVIII,  Book  1) the  time  is rightly expounded  by the  arc PI ;
and  the linear  part  of the medium  sy is moved  according  to the law  above-
mentioned,  that  is, according  to the  law  of  a pendulum  oscillating  ; and
the case  is the same  of all the  linear  parts  of which  the whole  medium   is

of the pulses propagated  from  that body.  As  soon,  therefore,  as the pulses
cease  to be propagated  from  the  tremulous  body,  it will  return  to  a state
of rest, and  move  no  more.

       PROPOSITION   XLVIII.   THEOREM   XXXVIII.

The  velocities  of pulses  propagated  in  an  elastic  fluid  are  in  a  ratin
  compounded  of the subduplicate,  ratio  of the  elastic force  directly, and
   the subduplicate  ratio of  the density  inversely ; supposing  the  elastic
  Jorce  of the fluid  to be proportional  to its condensation
  CASE  I.  If the mediums  be homogeneous,  and  the distances  of the pulses
in those mediums  be equal amongst  themselves,  but  the motion  in one  me
dium  is more  intense  than  in the  other,  the contractions  and  dilatations  of
the correspondent  parts  will  be  as those  motions  ; not  that  this proportion
is perfectly accurate.  However,  if the contractions  and  dilatations  are  not
exceedingly  intense,  the  error  will  not  be sensible  ; and  therefore  this pro
portion may  be considered  as  physically  exact. Now  the  motive  elastic
forces  are  as the contractions  and  dilatations  ; and  the velocities  generated
in the same  time  in equal  parts  are  as  the  forces.  Therefore  equal  and
corresponding  parts  of corresponding  pulses  will go  and  return  together,
through  spaces  proportional  to their contractions  and  dilatations,  with  ve
locities  that  are  as those  spaces  ; and  therefore  the  pulses, which  in  the

time  of one  going  and  returning  advance  forward  a  space  dq'aal to  their
breadth,  and  are always  succeeding  into  the places  of the  pulses  that  im
mediately  go before  them,  will, by reason  of the equality  of the  distances,
go forward  in both mediums  with  equal  velocity.
   CASE  2.  If the distances  of the pulses  or their  lengths  are greater  in one
medium  than  in another,  let  us suppose  that  the  correspondent  parts  de
scribe  spaces,  in going  and  returning,  each  time  proportional  to the breadths
of the  pulses ; then  will  their  contractions  and  dilatations  be  equal  : and
therefore  if the mediums  are homogeneous,  the motive  elastic  forces, which
agitate them  with  a reciprocal  motion,  will  be equal also.  Now  the matter
to be moved  by these  forces  is as the breadth  of the pulses ; and  the space
through  which  they move  every  time  they go  and  return  is in  the  same
ratio.  And,  moreover,  the  time  of one  going  and  returning  is in  a  ratic

compounded  of the subduplicate  ratio  of  the  matter, and  the  o-u'wuupncatc
 ratio  of the  space  ; and  therefore  is as the space.  But  the pulses advance
 a space  equal  to their breadths  in the times  of going  once  and  returning
 once;  that  is, they go  over  spaces  proportional  to the  times, and  therefore
 are  equally  swift.
   CASE  3. And  therefore  in mediums  of equal  density  and  elastic  force,
 all the pulses  are  equally swift.  Now   if the density  or the  elastic  force  of
 the medium  were  augmented,  then, because  the motive  force  is increased

| go forward i | n both mediums | with | equal velocity | . |  |  |

| therefore if t | he mediums are | homog | eneous, the | motive el | astic | forces, which |
| agitate them | with a reciproc | al moti | on, will be | equal also | . Now | the matter |

in the  ratio  of the  elastic  force, and  the matter  to be moved  is increased  in
the  ratio of  the  density,  the  time  which  is necessary  for producing  the
same  motion  as before  will  be increased  in the  subduplicate  ratio  of  the

and  the subduplicate  ratio  of the  elastic  force directly.  Q,.E.D.
   This  Proposition  will  be made  more  clear from  the construction  of the
following  Problem.

          PROPOSITION   XLIX.   PROBLEM  XL

 The. density  and  elastic force  of a medium  being  given,  to find  the,  ve
                                 locity of the pulses.
   Suppose  the medium   to be pressed  by an incumbent  weight  after  the manner
of our  air ; and  let A  be  the  height,  of a homogeneous  medium,  whose
weight  is equal  to the incumbent  weight, and  whose  density  is the  same
with  the density  of the compressed  medium  in which  the  pulses  are propa
gated.  Suppose  a pendulum  to be constructed  whose  length  between  the
point  of suspension  and  the  centre  of oscillation  is A  : and  in  the  time  in
which  that pendulum  will  perform  one  entire  oscillation  composed  of
its going  and  returning,  the  pulse  will  be  propagated  right onwards
through  a space  equal  to  the circumference  of  a circle described  with  the
radius  A.
   For,  letting  those  things  stand  which  were  constructed  in Prop. X.LV11,
if any  physical  line, as EF,  describing  the space PS  in each  vibration,  be
acted  on  in the extremities P  and  S  of  every going  and  return  that  it
makes  by an  elastic  force that  is equal  to  its weight,  it will perform  its
several  vibrations  in the time  in which  the same  might  oscillate  in  a  cy
cloid whose  whole  perimeter  is equal  to  the  length PS  ; and  that  because
equal  forces  will impel  equal  corpuscles  through  equal  spaces in  the  same
or equal times.  Therefore  since  the times  of the  oscillations  are  in  the
subduplicate  ratio  of  the lengths  of  the pendulums,  and  the length  of the
pendulum  is equal  to half  the  arc  of the whole  cycloid,  the time  of one  vi
bration  would  be  to the time  of the  oscillation  of  a pendulum  whose  length
 is A  in the subduplicate  ratio  of  the length ^PS  or PO  to the length  A.
 But  the  elastic  force  with  which  the physical  lineola EG   is urged,  when  it
 Is found  in  its extreme  places  P, S, was  (in the  demonstration  of  Prop.
XLVII)  to its whole  elastic  force  as HL  — KN   to  V, that  is (since  the
point K  now  falls upon  P), as HK   to V:  and  all that  force, or  which  is
 the same  thing,  the incumbent  weight  by which  the  lineola EG   is com
 pressed,  is to the weight  of the  lineola  as the altitude  A  of  the incumbent
weight  to EG  the length  of the lineola ; and  therefore,  ex  ctquo,  the  force

with which  the lincola EG   is urged  in  the places P  and S
is to the weight  of that  lineola  as HK  X A  to V X EG   ; or
as PO  X  A  to VV;  because HK  was  to EG   as PO  to V.
Therefore  since  the  times  in which  equal  bodies  are impelled
through  equal spaces  are  reciprocally  in  the  subduplicate
ratio  of the  forces, the  time  of one  vibration,  produced  by
the action  of that  elastic  force, will  be  to the time  of  a vi
bration, produced  by. the impulse  of  the weight  in  a subdu
plicate  ratio  of VV  to PO  X  A, and  therefore  to  the  time
of the  oscillation  of  a pendulum  whose  length  is A  in  the
subduplicate  ratio  of VV  to PO  X  A, and  the  subdupli
cate  ratio  of PO  to A  conjunctly  ; that  is, in the  entire  ra
tio of V  to A.  But  in  the  time  of  one

vibration  composed  of  the going  and  re
turning  of the pendulum,  the  pulse  will
be  propagated  right onward  through  a
space  equal  to  its breadth BC.  There
fore  the time  in which  a pulse  runs  over
 the space BC   is to the time  of one  oscillation  composed  of
the going  and  returning  of the pendulum  as V  to A, that  is,
as BC  to the circumference  of  a  circle whose  radius  is A.

But  the time  in which  the pulse  will run  over  the space BC
is to the time  in which  it will run  over  a length  equal  to
that circumference  in the same  ratio; and  therefore  in the
time  of such  an  oscillation  the pulse  will run  over  a length
equal  to that circumference.  G,.E.D.
   COR.  1. The  velocity  of the pulses  is equal  to that which
heavy  bodies  acquire  by  falling  with  an  equally  accele
rated  motion,  and  in  their  fall describing  half  the  alti
tude A.  For  the pulse  will, in  the time  of  this  fall, sup
posing  it to move  with  the  velocity  acquired  by  that  fall, run  over  a
 space that  will  be equal  to the  whole  altitude  A  ; and  therefore  in the
time  of one  oscillation composed  of one  going  and  return,  will go  over  a
 space  equal  to  the circumference  of a circle described  with  the  radius  A  ;
 for the time  of the  fall is to the time  of oscillation  as  the radius  of a circle
 to its circumference.
   COR.  2. Therefore  since  that  altitude A  is as the  elastic  force  of  the

 fluid  directly, and  the  density  of the same  inversely,  the  velocity  of  the
 pulses  will  be in  a ratio compounded  of the subduplicate  ratio  of the  den
 sity inversely,  and  the subduplicate  ratio  of the  clastic  force  directly.

           PROPOSITION    L.  PROBLEM   XII.

                       To find  the distances  of the pulses.
   Let  the number  of the vibrations  of the  body, by whose  tremor  the pulses
are produced;  be found  to  any given  time.  By  that number  divide  the
space which  a pulse  can  go  over  in the same  time, and  the part found  will
be  the breadth  of one pulse.  Q.E.I.

                     SCHOLIUM.

  The  last Propositions  respect  the motions  of light  and sounds ; for since
light  is propagated  in right  lines,  it is certain  that  it cannot  consist  in ac
tion  alone  (by Prop. XLI  and XLIl).  As  to sounds,  since  they  arise from
tremulous  bodies,  they can  be nothing  else but  pulses  of the  air propagated
through  it (by Prop. XLIII)  ; and  this  is confirmed  by the  tremors  which
sounds,  if they  be loud  and  deep,  excite  in the bodies  near  them,  as we  ex
perience  in the sound  of drums  ; for quick  and  short tremors  are  less easily
excited.  But  it is well known  that  any  sounds,  falling upon  strings  in
unison  with  the sonorous  bodies,  excite  tremors  in those  strings.  This  is
also confirmed  from  the velocity  of sounds;  for since  the  specific  gravities
of rain-water  and  quicksilver  are  to  one  another  as about  1 to 13f, and
when  the mercury  in the barometer  is at the height  of 30  inches  of  our
measure,  the  specific gravities  of the  air and  of rain-water  are  to  one
another  as about  1 to 870,  therefore  the  specific gravity  of  air and  quick
silver  are  to each  other  as  1  to 11890.  Therefore  when  the  height  of
the quicksilver  is at 30  inches,  a height  of uniform  air, whose  weight  would
be sufficient  to compress  our  air to the density  we  find  it to be  of, must  be
equal  to 356700  inches,  or 29725  feet of  our  measure  ; and  this  is  that
very height  of the medium,  which  I have  called A  in  the  construction  of
the foregoing  Proposition.  A  circle whose  radius  is 29725  feet  is 186768
feet in circumference.  And  since  a pendulum  39}  inches  in length  com
pletes one  oscillation, composed  of its going  and  return,  in two  seconds  of
time,  as  is commonly  known,  it follows  that  a pendulum  29725   feet, or
356700  inches  in length  will  perform  a like oscillation  in 190f  seconds.
Therefore  in that  time  a sound  will go  right onwards  186768   feet, and
therefore  in one  second  979  feet.
   But  in  this computation  we  have  made  no  allowance  for  the  crassitude
of the  solid  particles  of the  air, by which  the sound  is propagated  instan
taneously.  Because  the weight  of  air  is to the  weight  of water  as 1 tc
870, and  because  salts  are  almost  twice  as dense  as water ; if the  particles
 of air are supposed  to be  of near  the same  density  as those  of water  or  salt,
and  the  rarity  of the air  arises from  the  intervals  of the  particles ; the
diameter  of one  particle  of air will  be  to the  interval  between  the  centres

| tremulous bodi | es, they can b | e noth | ing else but | pulses | of the | air | propagated |
| through it (by | Prop. XLIII) | ; and | this is con | firmed | by the | tre | mors which |
| sounds, if they | be loud and | deep, | excite in the | bodies | near th | em, | as we ex |

| also confirmed | from the velo | city o | f sounds; f | or since | the spe | cifi | c gravities |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of rain-water | and quicksilve | r are | to one ano | ther as | about | 1 t | o 13f, and |
| when the merc | ury in the ba | romete | r is at the | height | of 30 | inc | hes of our |

| measure, the s | pecific graviti | es of | the air an | d of ra | in-wate | r | are to one |
| another as abo | ut 1 to 870, | therefo | re the specif | ic gravi | ty of | air | and quick |
| silver are to e | ach other as | 1 to | 11890. The | refore | when | the | height of |
| the quicksilver | is at 30 inch | es, a h | eight of uni | form ai | r, whose | we | ight would |
| be sufficient to | compress our | air to | the density | we fin | d it to | be o | f, must be |
| equal to 35670 | 0 inches, or | 29725 | feet of our | measur | e ; and | th | is is that |
| very height of | the medium, | which | I have call | ed A i | n the c | ons | truction of |
| the foregoing | Proposition. | A cir | cle whose ra | dius is | 29725 | feet | is 186768 |
| feet in circumf | erence. And | since | a pendulum | 39} i | nches i | n l | ength com |
| pletes one osci | llation, compo | sed of | its going a | nd retur | n, in t | wo | seconds of |
| time, as is com | monly known | , it f | ollows that | a pend | ulum | 297 | 25 feet, or |
| 356700 inches | in length wi | ll per | form a like | oscillat | ion in | 190 | f seconds. |
| Therefore in t | hat time a so | und wi | ll go righ | t onwar | ds 186 | 768 | feet, and |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| But in this | computation | we hav | e made no | allowanc | e for | the | crassitude |
| of the solid pa | rticles of the | air, b | y which the | sound | is propa | gat | ed instan |

| and the rarity | of the air ar | ises f | rom the int | ervals | of the | par | ticles ; t he |

of the  particles  as 1 to about  9 or 10, and  to the  interval  between  the par
ticles themselves  as 1 to 8 or 9.  Therefore  to 979  feet, which,  according  to
the above  calculation,  a sound  will advance  forward  in one  second  of time,

\ve may  add  ^-£9-, or about  109  feet, io compensate  for  the cra-ssitude  of the
particles  of the  air  : and  then  a sound  will go forward  about  1088  feet  in
one  second  of time.
   Moreover,  the vapours  floating  in the  air being  of another  spring, and  a
different  tone,  will  hardly,  if at  all, partake  of the motion  of the  true  air
in which  the sounds  are propagated.  Now  if these vapours  remain  unmov
ed, that motion  will  be propagated  the swifter  through  the  true  air alone,
and  that  in the subduplicate  ratio  of the  defect  of  the matter.  So  if the
atmosphere  consist  of ten  parts  of true  air and  one  part  of  vapours,  the
motion  of sounds  will  be swifter  in the subduplicate  ratio  of  11  to 10,  or
very  nearly  in the  entire  ratio  of 21  to  20, than  if it were  propagated
through  eleven  parts  of true  air  : and  therefore  the motion  of sounds  above
discovered  must  be increased  in that ratio.  By  this means  the sound  will
pass through  1 142  feet  in one  second  of time.
  These  things  will  be found  true  in spring  and  autumn,  when  the  air  is
rarefied by the gentle warmth  of those  seasons,  and  by that means  its elas
tic force becomes  somewhat  more  intense.  But  in winter, when  the  air  is
condensed  by the  cold, and  its elastic  force  is somewhat  remitted,  the  mo
tion  of sounds  will  be slower  in  a subduplicate  ratio  of the  density  ; and,
on  the other  hand,  swifter  in the summer.
  Now  by experiments  it actually  appears  that  sounds  do  really advance
in one  second  of time  about  1142  feet  of English  measure,  or 1070  feet of
French  measure.
   The  velocity  of sounds  being known,  the intervals  of the pulses  are known
also.  For  M. Sauveur,  by some  experiments  that  he made,  found  that  an
open  pipe about  five Paris  feet in length  gives  a sound  of the same  tone
with  a viol-string  that  vibrates  a hundred  times  in one second.  Therefore
there  are  near  10J  pulses  in  a space  of 1070  Paris  feet, which  a sound  runs
over  in asecond  of time  ; and  therefore  one  pulse  fills up  a space  of about  1 0T7-0
Paris  feet, that  is, about  twice  the length  of the pipe.  From  whence  it is
probable  that  the breadths  of  the  pulses,  in  all sounds  made  in open  pipes,
are  equal  to twice  the length  of the  pipes.
   Moreover,  from  the Corollary  of Prop. XLVIt  appears  the  reason why
the  sounds  immediately  cease  with  the motion  of  the sonorous  body, and
why  they are  heard  no  longer when  we  are  at  a great  distance  from  the
sonorous  bodies  than when  we  are very  near them.  And  besides, from  the
foregoing  principles,  it plainly  appears  how  it comes  to pass  that sounds  are
so mightily  increased  in speaking-trumpets  ; for  all reciprocal motion  usea
to be increased  by  the generating  cause  at each return.  And  in tubes  hin
dering  the dilatation  of  the  sounds,  the motion  decays  more  slowly, and
                                    24

| of the parti | cles | as 1 to about 9 | or 10, and | to the i | nterval b | etwee | n the par |

| the above c | alcula | tion, a sound w | ill advance | forwar | d in one | seco | nd of time, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| \ve may add | ^-£9- | , or about 109 | feet, io comp | ensate | for the c | ra-ss | itude of the |
| particles of | the | air : and then a | sound will | go forw | ard abou | t 10 | 88 feet in |
| one second | of ti | me. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Moreover, | the | vapours floatin | g in the ai | r being | of anothe | r sp | ring, and a |
| different ton | e, wi | ll hardly, if at | all, partake | of the | motion | of t | he true air |
| in which th | e sou | nds are propaga | ted. Now | if these | vapours | rema | in unmov |
| ed, that mot | ion | will be propagat | ed the swi | fter thr | ough the | true | air alone, |
| and that in | the | subduplicate rat | io of the de | fect of | the mat | ter. | So if the |
| atmosphere | consi | st of ten parts | of true air | and on | e part | of v | apours, the |
| motion of s | ounds | will be swifter | in the sub | duplicat | e ratio | of 1 | 1 to 10, or |
| very nearly | in t | he entire ratio | of 21 to 2 | 0, than | if it w | ere | propagated |
| through ele | ven | parts of true air | : and there | fore the | motion | of so | unds above |
| discovered | must | be increased in | that ratio. | By th | is means | the | sound will |
| pass throug | h 1 1 | 42 feet in one s | econd of tim | e. |  |  |  |
| These th | ings | will be found tr | ue in sprin | g and a | utumn, | when | the air is |
| rarefied by | the g | entle warmth o | f those seas | ons, and | by that | mea | ns its elas |

                    Of  the circular  motion  of fluids.

                              HYPOTHESIS.

 The  resistance  arising from  the want  of lubricity  in  the parts  of a fluid,
   is, casteris  paribus, proportional  to the velocity with  which  the parts  of
    the fluid  are  separated  fro?n  each  other.

         PROPOSITION    LI.  THEOREM  XXXIX.

If a  solid cylinder  infinitely  long, in an uniform  and  infinite fluid,  revolve
   with  an  uniform  motion  about  an  axis given  in position, and  the fluid
   be forced  round  by only  this  impulse  of the  cylinder, and  every part
   of the fluid persevere  uniformly  in  its 'motion ; I say, that  the periodic
   times  of the parts  of the fluid  are  as  their  distances  Jrom  the axis  of
   the cylinder.
                                        Let AFL   be  a cylinder  turning  uni
                                  formly  about  the  axis  S, arid  let  the
                                     concentric  circles BGM,  CHN,  DIO,
                              EKP,  &c., divide  the  fluid  into  innu
                                    merable  concentric  cylindric  solid  orbs
                                     of  the same  thickness.  Then,  because
                                      the  fluid  is homogeneous,  the  impres
                                          sions which  the contiguous  orbs make
                                  upon  each  other  mutually  will  be (by
                                     the Hypothesis)  as  their  translations
                                    from  each,  other, and  as the contiguous
                                        superficies  upon  which  the  impressions
are made.   If the impression  made  upon  any  orb  be greater  or less on  its
concave  than  on  its convex  side, the  stronger  impression  will prevail, and
will  either  accelerate  or  retard  the motion  of the  orb, according  as it agrees
with,  or  is contrary  to, the motion  of the same.  Therefore,  that  every  orb
may  persevere  uniformly  in  its motion,  the impressions  made  on  both  sides
must  be equal  and  their  directions  contrary.  Therefore  since  the impres
sions  are  as the contiguous  superficies, and  as  their  translations  from  one
another,  the  translations  will be inversely  as  the  superficies,  that  is, inversely
as the  distances  of  the  superficies  from  the axis.  But  the  differences  of

the  motion  of  the  parts among  themselves  will  not  be changed;  for the

 If a solid  sphere,  in an uniform  and  infinite fluid, revolves  about  an  axis
   given  in position  with  an uniform  motion., and  thejiuid  be forced  round

                                  thickness.  Suppose  those  orbs  to  be
                                           solid  ; and, because  the fluid  is homo
                                       geneous,  the impressions  which  the  con
                                    tiguous  orbs make  one  upon  another
                                     will  be  (by  the  supposition)  as  their

                                   contiguous  superficies  upon  which  the
impressions  are made.  If the impression  upon  any  orb  be greater  or less
upon  its concave  than  upon  its convex  side, the more  forcible  impression
will  prevail, and  will  either  accelerate  or retard  the  velocity  of the  orb,  ac
cording  as  it is directed  with  a conspiring  or  contrary  motion  to that  of
the orb.  Therefore  that  every  orb may  persevere  uniformly  in  its motion,
it is necessary  that  the impressions  made  upon  both  sides  of the  orb should
be equal, and  have  contrary  directions.  Therefore  since  the  impressions
are  as the contiguous  superficies,  and  as their  translations  from  one  another^
the translations  will  be inversely  as the  superficies,  that  is, inversely  as the
squares  of the distances  of  the  superficies from  the centre.  But  the  differ
ences  of the angular  motions  about  the  axis  are  as those  translations  applied
to the  distances,  or  as the translations  directly and  the distances  inversely;
that  is, by compounding  those  ratios, as  the cubes  of the  distances  inversely.

there  be  erected  the  perpendiculars  Aa,  B6.  Cc, Dd,  Ee, £c.; reciprocally
proportional  to  the  cubes  of SA5  SB, SO, SD,  SE,  etc., the sums  of  the
differences,  that  is, the whole  angular  motions  will  be  as the corresponding
sums  of  the  lines A#,  B&, Cc,  DC/, Ee,  <fcc., that  is (if to constitute  an  uni
formly  fluid medium  the number  of  the  orbs  be increased  and  their  thick
ness diminished  in  infinitum),  as  the  hyperbolic  areas AaQ,  B&Q,, CcQ,

Dtf'Q,, EeQ,,  etc., analogous  to the sums  ; and  the periodic  times  being  re
ciprocally  proportional  to  the  angular  motions,  will be  also  reciprocally
proportional  to those areas.  Therefore  the periodic time  of any  orb DIO
is reciprocally  as the area  Dt/Q,,  that  is (by the known  methods  of quadra
tures), directly  as the  square  of the  distance SD.  Which  was  first to  be
demonstrated.
  CASE  2. From  the  centre  of  the sphere  let there  be drawn  a great num
ber  of indefinite  right  lines, making  given  angles  with  the  axis, exceeding
one  another  by equal  differences  ; and, by these  lines revolving  about  the
axis, conceive  the  orbs  to be cut  into innumerable  annuli;  then  will every
annulus  have  four  annuli  contiguous  to  it, that  is, one  on  its inside,  one  on
its outside,  and  two  on  each hand.  Now  each  of these  annuli  cannot  be
impelled  equally  and  with  contrary  directions  by the  attrition  of  the  inte
rior and  exterior  annuli,  unless  the  motion  be communicated  according  to
the law  which  we  demonstrated  in Case 1.  This  appears  from  that dem
onstration.  And  therefore  any  series  of  annuli, taken  in any  right  line
extending  itself in infinitum  from  the  globe, will move  according  to the
law  of Case  1, except  we  should  imagine  it hindered  by the  attrition  of the
annuli  on  each  side  of it.  But  now  in  a motion,  according  to this law,  no
such  is, and  therefore  cannot  be, any  obstacle  to the motions  persevering
according  to  that law.  If annuli  at  equal  distances  from  the  centre
revolve  either  more  swiftly  or  more  slowly  near  the poles than  near  the
ecliptic, they will  be  accelerated  if slow, and  retarded  if swift, by  their
mutual  attrition;  and  so the  periodic  times  will  continually  approach  to
equality,  according  to the law  of Case  1.  Therefore  this  attrition  will not
at  all hinder  the motion  from  going  on according  to the law  of Case  1 , and
therefore  that  law  will take  place ; that  is, the periodic  times  of the several
annuli  will be  as the squares  of their  distances  from  the centre  of the globe.
Which  was  to be demonstrated  in the second  place.
   CASE  3. Let  now  every  annulus  be  divided  by transverse  sections  into
innumerable  particles  constituting  a substance  absolutely and  uniformly
fluid ; and  because  these  sections  do not  at  all respect  the  law  of  circular
motion,  but  only  serve  to produce  a fluid substance,  the law  of circular mo
tion will continue  the same  as before.  All  the very  small  annuli  will eithei
not  at  all change  their  asperity  and  force  of mutual  attrition  upon  account
of these  sections,  or  else they will change  the same  equally.  Therefore  the
proportion  of  the causes  remaining  the  same,  the proportion  of the  effects

| the law which | we demo | nstrated in Case | 1. This a | ppears fr | om that dem |

| such is, and t | herefore | cannot be, any ob | stacle to th | e motion | s persevering |

 will remain  the same  also ; that  is, the proportion  of  the motions  and  tin
 periodic times. Q.E.D.  But  now  as  the circular  motion,  and  the centri
 fugal  force thence  arising,  is greater  at the  ecliptic than  at the  poles, there
 must  be some  cause  operating  to retain  the several  particles  in their  ciicles ;
 otherwise  the matter  that  is at the  ecliptic will always  recede  from  the
 centre, and  come  round  about  to the  poles by the  outside  of  the vortex,
 and from  thence  return  by the axis  to the  ecliptic with  a perpetual  circu
 lation.

   COR.  1. Hence  the angular  motions  of the  parts  of  the fluid  about  the
 axis of the globe  are  reciprocally  as  the squares  of  the  distances  from  the
 centre  of the globe, and  the absolute  velocities  are  reciprocally  as the same
 squares  applied  to the distances  from  the  axis.
   COR.  2. If  a globe  revolve  with  a uniform  motion  about  an  axis  of  a
 given  position  in a similar  and  infinite  quiescent  fluid with  an  uniform
 motion,  it will communicate   a whirling  motion  to the  fluid  like  that  of  a
 vortex,  and  that motion  will by degrees  be propagated  onward  in infinitnm  ;
 and  this motion  will be increased  continually  in every  part  of the  fluid,  till
 the periodical  times  of  the several  parts become  as the squares  of  the  dis
 tances  from  the  centre  of the globe.
   COR.  3. Because  the inward  parts  of  the vortex  are by reason  of  their
greater  velocity  continually  pressing  upon  and  driving  forward  the  external
parts, and  by that  action  are  perpetually  communicating  motion  to them,

and  at the same  time  tho'se exterior  parts communicate  the same  quantity
of motion  to those  that  lie  still beyond  them,  and  by this  action  preserve
the quantity  of  their motion  continually  unchanged,  it  is plain  that  the
motion  is perpetually  transferred  from  the  centre  to the  circumference  of
the  vortex,  till it is quite swallowed  up  and  lost in the boundless  extent  of
that  circumference.  The  matter  between  any  two  spherical  superficies
concentrical  to  the vortex  will never  be  accelerated ; because  that  matter
will be always  transferring  the motion  it receives from  the matter  nearer
the centre  to that matter  which  lies nearer  the circumference.
   COR.  4. Therefore,  in  order  to continue  a vortex  in  the same  state  of
motion,  some  active  principle  is required  from  which  the globe may  receive
continually  the same  quantity  of motion  which  it is always communicating
to the matter  of the vortex.  Without  such  a principle  it will undoubtedly
come  to pass  that  the globe and  the  inward  parts  of  the vortex,  being  al
ways  propagating  their motion  to the outward  parts, and  not  receiving  any
new  motion,  will gradually  move  slower  and  slower,  and  at last be carried
round  no  longer.
   COR.  5. If another  globe  should  be swimming  in the same  vortex  at  a
certain  distance  from  its centre, and  in the mean  time  by some  force  revolve
constantly  about  an  axis  of  a given  inclination,  the  motion  of  Jiis globe
will  drive  the fluid round  after  the manner  of  a vortex  • and  at first  this

| will remain the | same also | ; that is, t he p | roportion | of the | motions and tin |
| periodic times. | Q.E.D. | But now as th | e circular | motion, | and the centri |
| fugal force then | ce arising, | is greater at t | he ecliptic | than at | the poles, there |
| must be some ca | use operati | ng to retain th | e several pa | rticles | in their ciicles |
| otherwise the m | atter that | is at the ecl | iptic will | always | recede from the |
| centre, and com | e round a | bout to the po | les by the | outside | of the vortex, |
| and from thence | return by | the axis to t | he ecliptic | with a | perpetual circu |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| lation. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| COR. 1. Hence | the angul | ar motions of | the parts | of the | fluid about the |
| axis of the glob | e are recipr | ocally as the | squares of | the dis | tances from the |
| centre of the glo | be, and the | absolute veloc | ities are r | eciproca | lly as the same |
| squares applied | to the dista | nces from the | axis. |  |  |
| COR. 2. If a | globe revol | ve with a uni | form moti | on abo | ut an axis of a |
| given position i | n a similar | and infinite | quiescent | fluid w | ith an uniform |
| motion, it will c | ommunicate | a whirling | motion to t | he fluid | like that of a |
| vortex, and that | motion will | by degrees be | propagated | onward | in infinitnm ; |
| and this motion | will be inc | reased continua | lly in ever | y part | of the fluid, till |
| the periodical ti | mes of the | several parts | become as | the squa | res of the dis |
| tances from the | centre of t | he globe. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| COR. 3. Becau | se the in | ward parts of | the vortex | are by | reason of their |
| greater velocity | continually | pressing upon | and drivin | g forwa | rd the external |
| parts, and by tha | t action a | re perpetually | communica | ting | motion to them, |

| of motion to tho | se that lie | still beyond | them, and b | y this | action preserve |

new  and  small  vortex  will  revolve  with  its globe  about  the centre  of  the
other;  and  in the  mean  time  its motion  will  creep  on  farther  and  farther,
and  by degrees  be propagated  in iiifinitum,  after  the  manner  of  the  first
vortex.  And  for the same  reason  that  the  globe of  the new  vortex  wat
carried  about  before  by the  motion  of  the  other  vortex,  the  globe  of  this
other  will  be carried  about  by the  motion  of  this  new  vortex,  sc that  the
two  globes  will revolve  about  some  intermediate  point, and  by reason  of
that  circular  motion  mutually  fly from  each  other, unless  some  force  re
strains them.  Afterward,  if the constantly  impressed  forces, by which  the
globes persevere  in  their  motions,  should  cease, and  every  thing  be  left to
act according  to the laws  of mechanics,  the motion  of  the  globes  will  lan
guish by degrees  (for the reason  assigned  in Cor.  3 arid  4), and  the vortices
at last will quite stand  still.
   COR.  6. If several  globes  in given  places  should  constantly  revolve  with
determined  velocities about  axes  given  in position,  there would  arise from
them  as many  vortices  going  on in infinitum.  For  upon  the same  account
that any  one  globe propagates  its motion  in  itifinitum,  each  globe  apart
will propagate  its own  motion  in infiidtwtn  also  ; so that  every  part  of the
infinite  fluid will  be  agitated  with  a motion  resulting  from  the  actions  of
all the globes.  Therefore  the  vortices  will  not  be confined  by any  certain
limits, but  by degrees  run  mutually  into  each  other  ; and  by the  mutual
actions  of the vortices  on  each  other,  the globes  will  be perpetually  moved
from  their  places,  as was  shewn  in  the  last  Corollary  ; neither  can  they
possibly  keep any  certain  position among  themselves,  unless  some  force  re
strains them.  But  if those  forces, which  are  constantly  impressed  upon
the globes  to continue  these  motions,  should  cease, the  matter  (for the  rea
son  assigned  in  Cor.  3 and  4) will  gradually  stop, and  cease  to move  in
vortices.

   COR.  7. If  a similar  fluid  be inclosed  in  a  spherical  vessel, and, by the
uniform  rotation  of a globe  in  its centre,  is driven  round  in  a vortex  ; and
the globe and  vessel revolve  the  same  way  about  the same  axis, and  their
periodical  times  be as the squares  of  the semi-diameters  ; the parts of  the
fluid will  not  go  on  in their  motions  without  acceleration  or retardation,
till their  periodical  times  are  as  the  squares  of  their  distances  from
the  centre  of  the vortex.  No  constitution  of  a vortex  can  be permanent
but  this.
   COR.  8.  If the  vessel, the  inclosed  fluid, and  the  globe, retain  this mo
tion, and  revolve  besides  with  a common  angular  motion  about  any  given
axis, because  the mutual  attrition  of  the parts of  the  fluid  is not changed
by this  motion,  the motions  of  the parts among  each  other  will  not  be
changed ; for the translations  of the parts among  themselves  depend  upon
this attrition.  Any  part will  persevere  in that motion  in which  its attri-

| and by degree | s be propagat | ed in iiifini | tum | , after the | manner | of the first |
| vortex. And | for the same | reason that | th | e globe of | the new | vortex wat |
| carried about | before by the | motion of | the | other vortex | , the g | lobe of this |
| other will be | carried about | by the moti | on | of this new | vortex, | sc that the |
| two globes wi | ll revolve abo | ut some in | term | ediate point | , and b | y reason of |
| that circular | motion mutua | lly fly from | e | ach other, un | less som | e force re |

| globes perseve | re in their m | otions, shoul | d c | ease, and ev | ery thin | g be left to |
| act according | to the laws of | mechanics, | the | motion of | the glob | es will lan |
| guish by degr | ees (for the re | ason assigned | in | Cor. 3 arid | 4), a nd | the vortices |
| at last will qu | ite stand still | . |  |  |  |  |
| COR. 6. If | several globes | in given pla | ces | should cons | tantly r | evolve with |
| determined ve | locities about | axes given | in p | osition, ther | e would | arise from |
| them as many | vortices going | on in infi | nit | um. For upo | n the sa | me account |
| that any one | globe propagat | es its moti | on | in itifinitum | , each | globe apart |
| will propagate | its own moti | on in infiidt | wtn | also ; so tha | t every | part of the |
| infinite fluid | will be agitat | ed with a mo | tio | n resulting | from the | actions of |
| all the globes | . Therefore | the vortices | will | not be conf | ined by | any certain |
| limits, but b | y degrees run | mutually in | to | each other ; | and by | the mutual |
| actions of the | vortices on e | ach other, th | e g | lobes will be | perpetu | ally moved |
| from their pla | ces, as was s | hewn in the | la | st Corollary | ; neith | er can they |
| possibly keep | any certain po | sition among | t | hemselves, u | nless so | me force re |
| strains them. | But if those | forces, whi | ch | are constant | ly impr | essed upon |
| the globes to | continue these | motions, sho | uld | cease, the | matter ( | for the rea |

| vortices. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

accelerates  it.
   COR.  9. Therefore  if the  vessel  be  quiescent,  and  the motion  of  the
globe  be given,  the motion  of the  fluid  will  be given.  For  conceive  a plane
to p«ass through  the  axis of  the  globe, and  to revolve  with  a contrary  mo
tion  ; and  suppose  the sum  of the time  of this revolution  and  of the revolu
tion of the  globe  to be  to the time  of  the  revolution  of  the  globe  as the
square  of the semi-diameter  of the vessel.to  the square  of the semi-diameter
of the globe ; and  the periodic  times  of  the parts  of  the  fluid  in respect  of
this plane  will  be  as the squares  of  their  distances  from  the centre  of  the

 globe.
   COR.  10. Therefore  if the vessel move  about  the same  axis with  the  globe,
 or with  a given  velocity  about  a different  one,  the motion  of the  fluid  will
 be given.  For  if from  the whole  system  we  take  away  the angular  motion
 of the  vessel,  all the motions  will remain  the same  among  themselves  as
 before, by Cor.  8, and  those  motions  will  be given by Cor.  9.
   COR.  11.  If the  vessel  and  the fluid  are  quiescent,  and  the globe  revolves
 with  an  uniform  motion,  that motion  will be propagated  by degrees through
 the whole  fluid  to the  vessel, and  the  vessel  will  be  carried  round  by  it,
 unless  violently  detained  ; and  the fluid  and  the  vessel  will  be continually
 accelerated  till their  periodic  times  become  equal  to the periodic  times  of
 the globe.  If the  vessel  be either withheld  by some  force,  or revolve  with
 any  constant  and  uniform  motion,  the medium   will come  by  little and
 little  to  the  state  of motion  defined  in Cor.  8, 9, 10, nor  will  it ever  perse
 vere  in any  other  state.  But  if then  the  forces, by which  the globe  and
 vessel  revolve  with  certain  motions,  should  cease, and  the whole  system  be
 left to act according  to the mechanical  laws,  the  vessel  and  globe, by means
 of the intervening  fluid, will  act upon  each  other, and  will  continue  to
 propagate  their motions  through  the  fluid  to each  other,  till their periodic
 times  become  equal among  themselves,  and  the whole  system  revolves  to
 gether  like  one  solid body.

    In  all these  reasonings  I suppose  the fluid  to consist  of matter  of uniform
 density  and  fluidity ; I mean,  that  the  fluid  is such, that  a  globe  placed
 any  where  therein  may  propagate  with  the same  motion  of its own,  at dis
 tances  from  itself continually  equal, similar  and  equal motions  in the  fluid
 in the same  interval  of time.  The  matter  by its circular  motion  endeavours
 to recede  from  the  axis  of the  vortex, and  therefore  presses  all the matter
 that  lies beyond.  This  pressure  makes  the  attrition  greater,  and  the
 Separation  of the  parts more  difficult  ; and  by  consequence  diminishes
 the fluidity  of the matter.  Again  ; if the parts  of the  fluid  are  in any  one
 place denser  or larger  than  in the  others, the  fluidity  will  be  less in  that
 [lace, because  there  are fewer  superficies  where  the parts  can  be  separated

| In all the | se reaso | ning | s I suppose the | flu | id to consist | of matt | er of uniform |
| density and | fluidity | ; I | mean, that the | flu | id is such, | that a | globe placed |
| any where t | herein | may | propagate with | the | same moti | on of i | ts own, at dis |

from  each other.  In these  cases  I suppose  the defect  of the  fluidity  to be
supplied  by the smoothness  or softness  of  the  parts,  or some  other  condi
tion  ; otherwise  the matter  where  it is less fluid  will cohere  more,  and  be
more  sluggish,  and  therefore  will receive  the motion  more  slowly,  and  pro
pagate  it farther  than  agrees  with  the  ratio above  assigned.  If the  vessel
be  riot spherical,  the particles  will move  in lines  not  circular, but  answer
ing  to the figure  of the  vessel ; and  the periodic  times  will be nearly  as the
squares  of the mean  distances  from  the centre.  In  the  parts between  the
centre  and  the circumference  the motions  will be slower  where  the  spaces
are  wide, and  swifter  where  narrow  ; but yet the particles  will  not  tend  to the
circumference  at all the more  for  their  greater  swiftness  ; for they  then
describe  arcs  of less curvity,  and  the conatus  of receding  from  the centre  is
 as much  diminished  by the diminution  of this curvature  as  it is augment
 ed by the  increase  of the velocity.  As  they go  out  of narrow  into  wide
 spaces,  they  recede  a little farther  from  the  centre,  but  in doing  so  are  re
 tarded  ; and when  they come  out  of wide  into narrow  spaces,  they  are again
 accelerated  ; and  so each  particle  is retarded  and  accelerated  by turns  for
 ever.  These  things  will come  to pass in  a rigid  vessel ; for  the  state  of
 vortices  in an  infinite  fluid  is known  by Cor.  6 of this Proposition.
    I have  endeavoured  in this Proposition  to investigate  the  properties  of
 vortices,  that  I might  find whether  the celestial phenomena  can  be explain
 ed by them;  for the phenomenon   is this, that  the  periodic  times  of  the
 planets  revolving  about  Jupiter  are  in the sesquiplicate  ratio  of  their  dis
 tances  from  Jupiter's  centre  ; and  the same  rule  obtains  also  among   the
 planets  that  revolve  about  the  sun.   And  these  rules  obtain  also  with  the
 greatest  accuracy,  as far  as has  been  yet discovered  by astronomical  obser-
 tion.   Therefore  if those  planets  are carried  round  in  vortices  revolving
 about  Jupiter  and  the  sun, the  vortices  must  revolve  according  to  that
 law.    But  here  we  found  the periodic  times  of the parts  of the  vortex  to
 be in the duplicate  ratio  of the distances  from  the  centre  of motion  ; and
 this  ratio cannot  be  diminished   and  reduced  to  the  sesquiplicate,  unless
 either  the matter  of the vortex  be more  fluid  the farther  it is from  the cen
  tre, or the resistance  arising from  the want  of lubricity  in the parts  of the
  fluid should,  as the velocity  with  which  the  parts  of the  fluid  are separated
 goes  on  increasing,  be augmented  with  it in  a greater  ratio  than  that  in
 which  the velocity  increases.    But  neither  of these suppositions  seem  rea
  sonable.    The  more  gross  and  less fluid  parts  will tend  to  the  circumfer
  ence,  unless  they  are heavy  towards  the  centre.   And  though,  for the sake
  of demonstration,  I proposed,  at the beginning  of this Section,  an Hypoth
  esis that  the resistance  is proportional  to the velocity,  nevertheless,  it is in
  truth  probable  that  the resistance  is in a less ratio  than  that  of the  velo
  city ; which  granted,  the periodic  times  of the  parts  of  the vortex  will  be
  in  a greater  than  the duplicate  ratio  of the distances  from  its  centre.     If,
  as some  think,  the vortices  move  more  swiftly  near  the  centre,  then  slower

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| supplied by th | e smooth | ness or softness | of the par | ts, or s | ome oth | er condi |
| tion ; otherwi | se the m | atter where it i | s less fluid | will co | here more | , and be |
| more sluggish, | and the | refore will rece | ive the moti | on more | slowly, | and pro |
| pagate it fart | her than | agrees with the | ratio above | assig | ned. If | the vessel |
| be riot spheric | al, the p | articles will mo | ve in lines | not circ | ular, but | answer |
| ing to the fig | ure of th | e vessel ; and t | he periodic | times wi | ll be nea | rly as the |
| squares of the | mean d | istances from th | e centre. | In the | parts be | tween the |
| centre and the | circumf | erence the moti | ons will be | slower | where t | he spaces |
| are wide, and | swifter w | here narrow ; b | ut yet the pa | rticles | will not t | end to the |
| circumference | at all | the more for th | eir greater | swiftne | ss ; f or | they then |
| describe arcs | of less c | urvity, and the | conatus of r | eceding | from the | centre is |
| as much dimi | nished b | y the diminutio | n of this cu | rvature | as it is | augment |
| ed by the inc | rease of | the velocity. A | s they go | out of | narrow | into wide |
| spaces, they | recede a | little farther fr | om the centr | e, but i | n doing | so are re |
| tarded ; and | when th | ey come out of | wide into na | rrow spa | ces, they | are again |
| accelerated ; | and so e | ach particle is r | etarded and | acceler | ated by | turns for |

| vortices in an | infinite | fluid is known | by Cor. 6 o | f this P | ropositio | n. |
| I have end | eavoured | in this Proposi | tion to inv | estigate | the pro | perties of |

| planets revol | ving abo | ut Jupiter are | in the sesqui | plicate | ratio of | their dis |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tances from J | upiter's | centre ; and the | same rule | obtains | also a | mong the |
| planets that | revolve | about the sun. | And these | rules ob | tain also | with the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| greatest accur | acy, as | far as has been | yet discover | ed by a | stronomic | al obser- |
| tion. Theref | ore if t | hose planets are | carried ro | und in | vortices | revolving |
| about Jupiter | and th | e sun, the vorti | ces must | revolve | accordin | g to that |
| law. But he | re we f | ound the periodi | c times of t | he parts | of the | vortex to |
| be in the dup | licate ra | tio of the distan | ces from t | he centr | e of mot | ion ; and |
| this ratio can | not be | diminished and | reduced to | the s | esquiplica | te, unless |
| either the ma | tter of | the vortex be mo | re fluid the | farther | it is fro | m the cen |

to a certain  limit, then  again  swifter  near  the  circumference,  certainly
neither  the sesquiplicate,  nor  any  other  certain  and  determinate  ratio, can
obtain  in them.  Let  philosophers  then  see how  that phenomenon  of  the
sesquiplicate  ratio  can  be accounted  for by vortices.

          PROPOSITION    LIII.  THEOREM   XLI.

Bodies  carried  about  in  a vortex, and  returning-  in  the same  orb, are  of
   the same  density with  the  vortex, and  are  moved  according  to  the
  same  law  with  the parts  of the vortex,  as  to velocity and  direction  oj
  motion.

  For  if any  small  part  of the vortex, whose  particles  or  physical  points
preserve  a given  situation among  each  other,  be supposed  to be congealed,
this particle  will move  according  to the same  law  as before,  since  no change
is made  either  in its density,  vis insita,  or figure.  And  again  ; if a congealed
or solid part  of the vortex  be of the same  density  with  the  rest  of the vortex,
and  be resolved  into  a fluid, this  will move  according  to  the same  law  as
before, except  in so far as  its particles, now  become  fluid, may  be moved
among  themselves.  Neglect,  therefore,  the motion  of the particles among
themselves  as not  at  all concerning  the progressive  motion  of the whole, and
the motion  of the whole  will be the same  as before.  But  this motion  will  be
the same  with  the motion  of other  parts  of  the vortex  at  equal  distances
from  the centre;  because  the  solid, now  resolved  into  a  fluid,  is become
perfectly  like  to the other  parts  of the vortex.  Therefore  a solid, if  it be
of the same  density  with  the matter  of the vortex,  will move  with  the same
motion  as the parts  thereof, being  relatively  at  rest in the matter  that  sur
rounds  it.  If it be more  dense,  it will endeavour  more  than  before  to  re
cede from  the centre  ; and  therefore  overcoming  that  force  of the  vortex,
by which,  being,  as it were,  kept, in equilibrio,  it was  retained  in  its orbit,
it will  recede  from  the centre, and  in  its revolution  describe  a  spiral,  re
turning  no longer  into  the same  orbit.  And,  by the same  argument,  if  it
be more  rare,  it will approach  to the centre.  Therefore  it can  never  con
tinually  go round  in the same  orbit, unless  it be of  the same  density  with
the fluid.  But  we  have  shewn  in that  case  that  it would  revolve  accord
ing  to the same  law  with  those  parts  of the  fluid  that  are  at the same  or
equal  distances  from  the centre  of the vortex.
   COR.  1. Therefore  a solid revolving  in  a vortex, and  continually  going
round  in the same  orbit,  is relatively  quiescent  in the  fluid  that  carries  it.
   COR.  2. And  if the vortex  be of an uniform  density,  the same  body may
revolve  at any  distance  from  the  centre  of the vortex.

| motion. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| For if any | small part of the | vor | tex, | whose particl | es or physic | al points |

| this particle w | ill move accordin | g | to the | same law as | before, since | no change |

| themselves as | not at all concern | ing | the | progressive mo | tion of the | whole, and |
| the motion of | the whole will be | the | same | as before. B | ut this moti | on will be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the same with | the motion of ot | her | part | s of the vorte | x at equal | distances |
| from the centr | e; because the s | olid | , no | w resolved i | nto a fluid, | is become |
| perfectly like | to the other parts | of | the | vortex. Ther | efore a soli | d, if it be |
| of the same de | nsity with the ma | tte | r of | the vortex, wi | ll move wit | h the same |

round  the sun  revolve  in ellipses, having  the sun  in  their common   focus  ;
and  by radii drawn  to the sun  describe
areas  proportional  to the times.  But
now  the parts  of a vortex  can  never  re
volve  with  such  a motion.  Let  AD,
BE,  CF,  represent  three  orbits  describ
ed about  the sun  S, of which  let  the
utmost  circle CF  be  concentric  to the
sun  ; and  let the aphelia  of the two  in
nermost  be A, B  j and  their  perihelia
D, E.  Therefore  a body revolving  in
the  orb CF,  describing,  by a  radius
drawn  to the  sun,  areas  proportional  to
the  times,  will move  with  an uniform  motion.  And,  according  to the laws
of astronomy,  the body  revolving  in the orb BE  will move  slower  in  its
aphelion  B, and  swifter  in  its perihelion E  ; whereas,  according  to  the
laws  of mechanics,  the matter  of the vortex  ought  to move  more  swiftly  in
the narrow  space between  A  and  C  than  in the wide  space between  D  and
F ; that  is, more  swiftly  in the aphelion  than  in the perihelion.  Now  these
two  conclusions  contradict  each other.  So  at the beginning  of the sign of
Virgo, where  the aphelion  of Mars  is at present,  the distance  between   the*
orbits  of Mars  and  Venus  is to the distance  between  the same  orbits,  at the
beginning  of the sign  of Pisces,  as about  3 to 2 ; and  therefore  the  matter
of the vortex  between  those  orbits ought  to be swifter  at the beginning  of
Pisces  than  at the beginning  of Virgo  in  the ratio  of 3 to 2 ; for the  nar
rower  the space  is through  which  the same  quantity  of matter  passes  in the
same  time  of one  revolution,  the greater  will  be  the velocity  with  which  it
passes through  it.  Therefore  if the earth  being  relatively  at  rest in  this
celestial matter  should  be carried  round  by  it, and  revolve  together  with  it
about  the  sun,  the  velocity of  the  earth  at  the  beginning  of  Pisces
would  be to its velocity  at the beginning  of Virgo  in  a sesquialteral  ratio.
Therefore  the  sun's apparent  diurnal  motion  at  the  beginning  of Virgo
ought  to be above  70 minutes,  and  at the beginning  of Pisces  less than  48
minutes;  whereas,  on  the  contrary,  that  apparent  motion  of  the  sun  is
really greater  at the beginning  of Pisces  than  at the  beginning  of Virgo;
as experience  testifies  ; and  therefore  the  earth  is swifter  at the beginning
of Virgo  than  at the beginning  of Pisces ; so that  the  hypothesis  of  vor
tices  is utterly  irreconcileable  with  astronomical  phenomena,  and  rather
serves  to perplex  than  explain  the  heavenly  motions.  How   these mo
tions  are  performed  in  free  spaces  without  vortices, may  be understood
by the  first Book  j and  I shall now  more  fully  treat  of  it in the following

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun ; and let th | e aphelia of the t | wo in |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| nermost be A, | B j and their per | ihelia |  |  |  |
| D, E. Therefo | re a body revolv | ing in |  |  |  |
| the orb CF, | describing, by a | radius |  |  |  |
| drawn to the su | n, areas proportio | nal to |  |  |  |
| the times, will | move with an uni | form motio | n. And | , according | to the laws |
| of astronomy, t | he body revolving | in the orb | BE wi | ll move slo | wer in its |
| aphelion B, an | d swifter in its | perihelion | E ; wher | eas, accordi | ng to the |
| laws of mechanic | s, the matter of | the vortex | ought t | o move more | swiftly in |
| the narrow spac | e between A and | C than in | the wide | space betw | een D and |
| F ; t hat is, m ore | swiftly in the ap | helion than | in the | perihelion. | Now these |
| two conclusions | contradict each o | ther. So a | t the be | ginning of | the sign of |
| Virgo, where th | e aphelion of Mar | s is at pres | ent, the | distance b | etween the* |
| orbits of Mars | and Venus is to th | e distance | between | the same or | bits, at the |
| beginning of the | sign of Pisces, as | about 3 t | o 2 ; an | d therefore | the matter |
| of the vortex be | tween those orbits | ought to | be swifte | r at the be | ginning of |
| Pisces than at t | he beginning of V | irgo in the | ratio | of 3 to 2 ; f | or the nar |
| rower the space | is through which | the same q | uantity | of matter pa | sses in the |
| same time of one | revolution, the g | reater will | be the | velocity wit | h which it |
| passes through | it. Therefore if | the earth b | eing rel | atively at r | est in this |
| celestial matter | should be carried | round by i | t, a nd r | evolve toget | her with it |
| about the sun, | the velocity of | the earth | at the | beginning | of Pisces |
| would be to its | velocity at the be | ginning of | Virgo | in a sesquialt | eral ratio. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Therefore the s | un's apparent di | urnal motio | n at t | he beginnin | g of Virgo |
| ought to be abo | ve 70 minutes, an | d at the be | ginning | of Pisces le | ss than 48 |
| minutes; wherea | s, on the contra | ry, that ap | parent | motion of | the sun is |
| really greater a | t the beginning of | Pisces tha | n at th | e beginning | of Virgo; |
| as experience te | stifies ; and theref | ore the ear | th is sw | ifter at the | beginning |
| of Virgo than a | t the beginning o | f Pisces ; so | that t | he hypothesi | s of vor |
| tices is utterly | irreconcileable wi | th astrono | mical p | henomena, | and rather |
| serves to perpl | ex than explain | the heaven | ly moti | ons. How | these mo |
| tions are perf | ormed in free spa | ces withou | t vortic | es, may be | understood |
| by the first Boo | k j and I shall no | w more ful | ly treat | of it in the | following |

        BOOK   III.




   IN  the preceding  Books  I have  laid down  the  principles  of philosophy       ,
principles  not  philosophical,  but  mathematical  : such, to  wit, as we  may
build  our  reasonings  upon  in philosophical  inquiries.  These  principles  are
the laws  and  conditions  of certain  motions, and  powers  or  forces, which
chiefly have  respect  to philosophy  : but, lest they should  have  appeared  of
themselves  dry and  barren,  I have  illustrated  them  here  and  there with
some  philosophical  scholiums,  giving  an  account  of  such  things  as are  of
more  general  nature,  and  which  philosophy  seems  chiefly  to be founded  on  ;
such  as the  density  and  the  resistance  of  bodies,  spaces  void  of  all bodies,
and  the motion  of light and sounds.   It remains  that, from  the same  prin
ciples, I now  demonstrate  the  frame  of  the System  of  the World.  Upon
this subject  I had, indeed, composed  the  third Book  in a popular  method,
that  it might  be read  by many ; but  afterward,  considering  that  such  as
had  not  sufficiently  entered  into  the principles  could  not  easily discern  the
strength  of the consequences,  nor  lay aside  the  prejudices  to which  they had
been many  years  accustomed,  therefore,  to prevent  the disputes  which  might
be raised upon  such  accounts,  I chose  to reduce  the  substance  of this Book
into  the form  of Propositions  (in the mathematical  way), which  should  be
read by those  only who  had  first made  themselves  masters  of the  principles
established  in the preceding  Books  : not  that  I would  advise  any  one  to the
previous  study  of every Proposition  of those Books ; for they abound  with
such  as might  cost  too much  time, even  to  readers  of good  mathematical
learning.  It is enough  if one  carefully  reads  the Definitions,  the Laws  of
Motion,  and  the  first three  Sections  of  the  first Book.  He  may  then  pass
on  to this  Book,  and  consult  such  of the remaining  Propositions  of  the
first two  Books,  as the references  in this, and  his occasions,  shall  require.

384           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III.


      RULES  OF REASONING  IN  PHILOSOPHY,


                       RULE    I.

 We  are  I'o admit  no  more  causes  of natural  things  than  such  as  are both
                true and  sufficient  to explain  their appearances.
   To  this purpose  the philosophers  say that Nature  does  nothing  in vain,
 and more  is in vain when  less will  serve ; for Nature  is pleased  with  sim
 plicity, and  affects  not  the pomp  of superfluous  causes.

                       RULE    II.

 Therefore  to the same  natural  effects we  must,  as far  as possible, assign
                                   the same  causes.

   As  to respiration  in a man  and  in a beast;  the descent  of stones  in Europe
 and  in America  ; the light of  our  culinary  fire and  of the sun ; the  reflec
 tion  of light in the  earth, and  in the  planets.

                      RULE    III.

 The  qualities  of bodies, which  admit  neither  intension  nor  remission  oj
   degrees, and  which  are  found  to belong  to all bodies  within  the  reach
   of our  experiments,  are  to be esteemed  the  universal  qualities  of all
   bodies  whatsoever.
   For  since  the qualities  of bodies  are  only known  to us by experiments,  we
are  to hold  for universal  all such  as  universally  agree  with  experiments  ;
nnd  such  as  are  not liable  to diminution  can  never  be quite taken  away.
We  are  certainly  not  to relinquish  the evidence  of experiments  for the sake
of dreams  and  vain  fictions of  our  own  devising  ; nor  are we  to recede from
the analogy  of Nature,  which  uses  to be simple, and  always  consonant   to
itself. We  no  other way know  the extension  of bodies  than  by our  senses,
nor  do  these reach  it in  all bodies;  but  because  we  perceive  extension  in
all that  are  sensible,  therefore  we  ascribe  it universally  to  all others  also.
That  abundance  of  bodies  are  hard, we  learn  by experience  ; and  because
the hardness  of the whole  arises from  the hardness  of the  parts, we  therefore
justly  infer  the hardness  of  the undivided  particles  not  only of  the bodies
we  feel but  of all others.  That  all bodies  are impenetrable,  we  gather  not
from  reason,  but from  sensation.  The  bodies  which  we  handle  we  find im
penetrable,  and  thence  conclude  impenetrability  to be an  universal  property
of all bodies whatsoever.  That  all bodies  are  rnoveable,  and  endowed  with
certain  powers  (which  we  call the  vires  inertias]  of persevering  in their mo
tion, or in their  rest, we  only infer  from  the  like properties  observed  in the

|  |  | RULE I. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| We are I'o admit n | o more cau | ses of natural | things tha | n such as | are both |
| true a | nd sufficien | t to explain t | heir appeara | nces. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| To this purpose | the philoso | phers say that | Nature doe | s nothing | in vain, |
| and more is in vain | when less | will serve ; f | or Nature i | s pleased | with sim |
| plicity, and affects | not the pom | p of superflu | ous causes. |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | RULE II. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Therefore to the s | ame natura | l effects we mu | st, as far | as possible | , assign |
|  | t | he same causes | . |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| As to respiration | in a man a | nd in a beast; | the descent | of stones i | n Europe |
| and in America ; t | he light of | our culinary | fire and of t | he sun ; t | he reflec |
| tion of light in the | earth, and | in the planets. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | RULE III. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The qualities of bo | dies, which | admit neith | er intension | nor remi | ssion oj |
| degrees, and whi | ch are fo | und to belong | to all bodies | within t | he reach |
| of our experimen | ts, are to | be esteemed | the univers | al qualiti | es of all |
| bodies whatsoever | . |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| For since the qual | ities of bo | dies are only k | nown to us | by experim | ents, we |
| are to hold for univ | ersal all s | uch as univers | ally agree | with expe | riments ; |
| nnd such as are not | liable to | diminution ca | n never be | quite take | n away. |
| We are certainly no | t to relinqu | ish the eviden | ce of experi | ments for | the sake |
| of dreams and vain | fictions of | our own devis | ing ; nor are | we to rec | ede from |
| the analogy of Natu | re, which | uses to be sim | ple, and al | ways cons | onant to |
| itself. We no othe | r way know | the extension | of bodies t | han by ou | r senses, |
| nor do these reach | it in all b | odies; but bec | ause we per | ceive exte | nsion in |
| all that are sensible | , therefore | we ascribe it | universally | to all oth | ers also. |
| That abundance of | bodies are | hard, we lea | rn by experi | ence ; and | because |
| the hardness of the | whole arises | from the hard | ness of the | parts, we | therefore |
| justly infer the hard | ness of th | e undivided pa | rticles not | only of t | he bodies |
| we feel but of all o | thers. That | all bodies ar | e impenetrab | le, we ga | ther not |
| from reason, but fr | om sensatio | n. The bodies | which we | handle we | find im |
| penetrable, and then | ce conclude | impenetrabili | ty to be an | universal | property |
| of all bodies whatso | ever. Tha | t all bodies ar | e rnoveable, | and endow | ed with |
| certain powers (whic | h we call t | he vires inertia | s] of persev | ering in t | heir mo |
| tion, or in their rest | , we only i | nfer from the | like properti | es observe | d in the |

 bodies  which  we have  seen.  The  extension,  hardness,  impenetrability,  mo
 bility, and  vis  inertia  of  the whole,  result  from  the  extension,  hardness,
 impenetrability,  mobility, and  vires  inertia  of  the  parts;  and  thence  we
 conclude  the  least particles  of  all bodies  to be also  all extended,  and  hard
 and  impenetrable,  and moveable,  and endowed  with  their proper  vires  inertia.
And  this  is the foundation  of  all philosophy.  Moreover,  that  the divided
 but contiguous  particles  of  bodies  may  be  separated  from  one  another,  is
matter  of  observation  ; and, in the  particles  that  remain  undivided,  our
minds  are  able  to distinguish  yet lesser  parts,  as  is mathematically  demon
strated.  But  whether  the  parts  so distinguished,  and  not  yet divided, may,
by the powers  of Nature,  be  actually  divided  and  separated  from  one  an
other, we  cannot  certainly determine.  Yet, had  we  the proof  of  but  one
experiment  that any  undivided  particle,  in breaking  a hard  and  solid  body,
suffered  a division, we  might  by virtue  of  this rule  conclude  that  the un
divided  as well  as the  divided  particles may  be divided  and  actually  sep
arated  to infinity.
   Lastly,  if it universally  appears, by experiments  and  astronomical  obser
vations,  that  all bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the  earth, and
that  in proportion  to the quantity  of matter  which  they severally  contain  ;
that  the moon  likewise,  according  to the quantity  of  its matter,  gravitates
towards  the earth ; that, on  the other  hand,  our  sea gravitates  towards  the
moon  ; and  all the planets mutually  one towards  another  ; and  the comets
in like manner  towards  the  sun  ; we  must,  in consequence  of this  rule, uni
versally  allow  that  all bodies whatsoever  are  endowed  with  a principle  ot
mutual  gravitation.  For  the argument  from  the appearances  concludes  with
more  force  for the universal  gravitation  of all bodies  than  for  their impen
etrability  ; of which, among  those  in the  celestial  regions, we  have  no  ex
periments,  nor  any manner  of observation.  Not  that  I affirm  gravity  to be
essential  to bodies  : by their  vis insita  I mean  nothing  but  their  vis  iiicrticz.
This  is immutable.  Their  gravity  is diminished  as they  recede from  the
earth.

                      RULE   IV.

In experimental  philosophy  we  are  to look  upon  propositions  collected by
   general  induction  from, phenomena   as  accurately  or very nearly  true,
  notwithstanding  any  contrary  hypotheses  that may  be imagined,   till
   such  time  as  other phenomena   occur, by which  they may  either  be made
  more  accurate,  or liable  to exceptions.
  This  rule we  must  follow,  that  the argument  of  induction  may  not  bf
evaded  by hypotheses.

| bility, and vis ine | rtia of t | he whole, re | sult | from th | e extension, | hardness, |
| impenetrability, mo | bility, a | nd vires ine | rtia | of the | parts; and | thence we |
| conclude the least | particles | of all bodies | to b | e also a | ll extended, | and hard |
| and impenetrable, | and moveab | le, and endo | wed | with thei | r proper vir | es inertia. |
| And this is the fo | undation | of all philo | sophy | . Moreo | ver, that t | he divided |

| matter of observat | ion ; and, | in the par | ticles | that r | emain undi | vided, our |
| minds are able to | distinguish | yet lesser | parts, | as is ma | thematicall | y demon |
| strated. But whet | her the p | arts so disti | nguish | ed, and | not yet div | ided, may, |
| by the powers of N | ature, be | actually di | vided | and s | eparated fro | m one an |
| other, we cannot | certainly | determine. | Yet, | had we | the proof o | f but one |
| experiment that an | y undivid | ed particle, | in br | eaking a | hard and s | olid body, |
| suffered a division, | we migh | t by virtue | of th | is rule | conclude th | at the un |
| divided as well as | the divid | ed particles | may | be divi | ded and act | ually sep |
| arated to infinity. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Lastly, if it uni | versally a | ppears, by e | xperim | ents an | d astronomi | cal obser |
| vations, that all bo | dies abou | t the earth | gra | vitate t | owards the | earth, and |
| that in proportion | to the qu | antity of ma | tter | which t | hey severally | contain |
| that the moon like | wise, acco | rding to the | quan | tity of | its matter, | gravitates |
| towards the earth ; | that, on | the other ha | nd, o | ur sea g | ravitates to | wards the |
| moon ; and all the | planets m | utually one | towa | rds ano | ther ; and t | he comets |

 That  the circumjovial  planets,  by radii drawn   to Jupiter's  centre, de
   scribe  areas  proportional  to the  times  of description ; and  that  their
  periodic  times,  the fixed  stars being  at  rest, are in  the  sesquiplicate
   proportion  of their  distances  from,  its centre.
   This  we know  from  astronomical  observations.  For  the  orbits  of  these
planets  differ but insensibly from  circles  concentric  to Jupiter ; and  their
motions  in those  circles  are found  to be uniform.  And  all astronomers
agree  that  their periodic  times  are in the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  the
semi-diameters  of  their  orbits;  and  so it manifestly  appears  from  the  fol-

   Mr. Pound  has  determined,  by the help  of  excellent  micrometers,  the
diameters  of Jupiter  and  the elongation  of its satellites  after  the following
manner.  The  greatest  heliocentric  elongation  of  the fourth  satellite from

Tupiter's  centre  was  taken  with  a micrometer  in a 15  feet  telescope, and  at
the mean  distance  of Jupiter from  the  earth  was  found  about  8' 16".  The
elongation  of the  third  satellite was  taken  with  a micrometer  in a telescope
of 123  feet, and  at the same  distance  of  Jupiter  from  the earth  was  found

4' 42".  The  greatest  elongations  of  the  other  satellites,  at the same  dis
tance  of Jupiter  from  the  earth,  are found  from  the periodic  times  to be  2'
56"  47'", and  1' 51"  6'".
  The  diameter  of  Jupiter  taken  with  the  micrometer  in a 123  feet  tele

scope  several  times, and  reduced  to Jupiter's mean  distance  from  the  earth,

 which  two  satellites,  the  first and  the  third, passed  over Jupiter's  body, were
 observed,  from  the beginning  of the ingress  to the beginning  of  the  egress,
 and  from  the  complete  ingress  to  the  complete  egress,  with  the  long  tele
 scope.  And  from  the  transit  of  the  first satellite, the diameter  of Jupiter
 at its mean  distance  from  the earth  came  forth  37 J-". and  from  the  transit
 of the  third 371".  There  was  observed  also  the time  in which  the shadow
 of the  first satellite  passed  over  Jupiter's  body, and  thence  the diameter  of
 Jupiter  at  its mean  distance  from  the  earth  came  out  about 37".  Let  us
 suppose  its diameter  to be 37}"  very  nearly, and  then  the greatest  elonga
 tions  of  the  first, second,  third, and  fourth  satellite  will  be  respectively
 equal  to 5,965,  9,494,  15,141,  and  26,63  semi-diameters  of  Jupiter.

  The  greatest  elongation  of the  fourth  satellite from  Saturn's  centre  is
commonly  determined  from  the  observations  to be  eight of  th-»se  semi-
diameters  very nearly.  But  the  greatest  elongation  of this  satellite from

Saturn's  centre, when  taken  with  an  excellent  micrometer  iuMr../fuyg'en8>
telescope  of 123  feet, appeared  to be eight semi-diameters  and  T7-0 of  a semi-
diameter.  And  from  this observation  arid the periodic  times  the distances

of the  satellites  from  Saturn's  centre  in serni-diameters  of the ring  are  2.1.
2,69.  3,75.  8,7. and 25,35.  The  diameter  of Saturn  observed  in the  same
telescope was  found  to  be  to the  diameter  of  the  ring  as 3 to 7 ; and  the
diameter  of the ring, May  28-29,  1719,  was  found  to be 43"  ; and  th:*nce
the diameter  of  the  ring when  Saturn  is at  its mean  distance  from  the

earth  is 42", and  the diameter  of Saturn  18".  These  things  appear  so in
very long and  excellent  telescopes,  because  in such  telescopes  the apparent
magnitudes  of the heavenly  bodies  bear  a greater  proportion  to the  dilata
tion  of light  in the  extremities  of  those  bodies  than  in shorter  telescopes.

 That  the five primary  planets, Mercury,  Venus, Mars,  Jupiter, and  Sat
              urn,  with  their  several  orbits, encompass  the  sun.
   That  Mercury  and Venus  revolve  about  the  sun, is evident  from  their
moon-like  appearances.  When  they  shine  out with  a full  face, they  are, in
respect  of  us, beyond  or above  the sun  ; when  they appear  half  full, they
are  about  the same  height  on  one  side  or  other  of  the  sun  ; when  horned,
they  are below  or between  us  and  the  sun  ; and  they  are sometimes,  when
directly  under,  seen  like spots traversing  the  sun's disk.  That  Mars  sur
rounds  the sun,  is as plain from  its full  face when  near  its conjunction  with
the  sun. and  from  the gibbous  figure which  it shews  in  its quadratures.
And  the same  thing  is demonstrable  of Jupiter  and  Saturn,  from  their  ap
pearing  full  in all situations  ; for  the shadows  of their  satellites  that appear
sometimes  upon  their  disks make   it plain  that  the light they  shine  with  is
not  their own,  but borrowed  from  the  sun.

               PHENOMENON    IV.

That  the fixed  stars  being  at  rest,  the periodic  times  of  the five primary
   planets, and  (whether  of the  suit  about  the  earth,  or) of the earth  about
   the sun,  are in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their mean  distances
  from  the sun.
   This  proportion,  first observed  by Kepler,  is now  received  by  all astron
omers  ; for the  periodic  times  are  the same,  and  the dimensions  of the orbits
are  the same,  whether  the sun  revolves  about  the  earth,  or the  earth  about
the sun.  And  as  to the measures  of the periodic  times,  all astronomers  are
agreed  about  them.  But  for the dimensions  of the  orbits, Kepler  and Bul-
lialdns,  above  all others, have  determined  them  from  observations  with  the
greatest  accuracy  ; and  the mean  distances  corresponding  to  the periodic
times  differ but  insensibly  from  those which  they have  assigned,  and  for
the most  part  fall in between  them  ; as we may  see from  the following  table.

  As  to Mercury  and  Venus,  there  can  be no doubt  about  their  distances
from  the sun ; for they  are determined  by the elongations  of  those  planets
from  the  sun  ; and  for the distances  of  the superior  planets,  all dispute  is
cut  off by  the  eclipses of  the  satellites  of Jupiter.  For  by those  eclipses
the position  of  the shadow  which  Jupiter  projects  is determined  ; whence
we  have  the  heliocentric  longitude  of Jupiter.  And  from  its  helio
centric  and  geocentric  longitudes  compared  together, we  determine   its
distance.

               PHENOMENON    V.

Then  the primary  planets, by radii drawn   to the earth,  describe  areas  no
   wise proportional  to the times  ; but  that  the areas  which  they  describe
   by radii drawn  to the snn  are proportional  to the  times  of descrip
   tion.

  For  to the  earth  they appear  sometimes  direct, sometimes  stationary,
nay, and  sometimes  retrograde.  But  from  the  sun  they  are always  seen
direct, and  to proceed  with  a motion  nearly  uniform,  that  is to  say, a little
swifter  in the perihelion  and  a little slower  in the aphelion  distances,  so  as
to maintain  an  equality  in the  description  of  the  areas.  This  a  noted
proposition among  astronomers,  and  particularly  demonstrable  in Jupiter,
from  the  eclipses  of his satellites;  by the help  of which  eclipses,  as we have
said, the  heliocentric  longitudes  of that  planet, and  its distances  from  the
sun,  are determined.

               PHENOMENON    VI.

That  the moon,  by  a radius  drawn   to the earths  centre, describes  an  area
  proportional  to the time  of description.
   This  we  gather  from  the apparent  motion  of the  moon,  compared  with
its apparent diameter.   It is true  that  the motion  of the moon  is a little
disturbed  by the action  of the sun  : but  in laying down  these Phenomena
I neglect  those  imall  and  inconsiderable  errors.

             PROPOSITIONS-

            PROPOSITION     I.  THEOREM    I.

That  the forces  by which  the circumjovial  planets  are continually  drawn
   off from  rectilinear  motions,  and  retained  in  their  proper  orbits, tend

   to Jupiter's  centre  ; and  are  reciprocally  as  the squares  of the distances
   of the places  of those  planets/ro?/i  that  centre.
  The  former  part  of this Proposition  appears  from  Pham.  I, and  Prop.
II or  III, Book  I : the  latter from  Phaen.  I, and  Cor.  6, Prop.  IV, of the same
Book.
  The  same  thing  we  are  to understand  of the  planets which  encompass
Saturn,  by Phaon.  II.

           PROPOSITION    II.  THEOREM    II.

That  the forces  by which  the primary  planets  are  continually  drawn  off
 from   rectilinear  motions,  and  retained  in their  proper  orbits, tend  to
   the  sun.  ; and  are  reciprocally  as  the squares  of the distances  of  the

   places  of those  planets from  the sun's  centre.
  The  former  part  of  the  Proposition  is manifest  from  Phasn.  V, and
Prop.  II, Book  I ; the  latter from  Phaen.  IV, and  Cor.  6, Prop.  IV, of  the
same Book.  But  this part  of  the Proposition  is, with  great  accuracy,  de
monstrable  from  the quiescence  of the  aphelion  points ; for  a  very  small
aberration  from  the reciprocal  duplicate  proportion  would  (by Cor.  1, Prop.
XLV,  Book  I) produce  a motion  of the  apsides  sensible  enough  in every
single revolution,  and  in many  of them  enormously  great.

           PROPOSITION    III.  THEOREM    III.

That  the force  by which  the moon  is retained  in  its  orbit tends  to  the
   earth  ; and  is reciprocally  as  the square  of the  distance  of  its  plac>>,
  from  the earths  centre.
   The  former  part  of the Proposition  is evident  from  Pha3n.  VI, and  Prop.

II or III, Book  I ; the  latter from  the very  slow  motion  of the moon's  apo
gee;  which  in  every  single  revolution  amounting  but  to  3°  3' in  conse-
quentia, may  be neglected.  For  (by Cor.  1. Prop. XLV,  Book  I) it ap

pears,  that,  if the  distance  of the moon  from  the  earth's  centre  is to  the
semi-diameter  of the earth  as D  to  1, the  force, from  which  such  a motion
will  result,  is reciprocally  as D2^f  3, i. e., reciprocally  as the power  of D,
whose  exponent  is 2^^  ; that  is to say, in the proportion  of  the distance
something  greater  than  reciprocally  duplicate,  but  which  comes  59f  time?
nearer  to the duplicate  than  to the triplicate proportion.  But  in regard
that  this motion  is owinsr  to the  action  of the sun  (as we  shall afterwards

shew),  it is here  to be neglected.  The  action  of the  sun, attracting  the

moon  from  the  earth,  is nearly  as the moon's  distance  from  the earth ; and
therefore  (by what  we  have  shewed  in Cor.  2, Prop. XLV.  Book  I) is to the
centripetal  force  of the moon  as 2 to 357,45,  or nearly  so ; that  is, as 1  to
178£  f- .  And  if we  neglect  so inconsiderable  a force  of  the  sun,  the  re
maining  force, by which  the moon   is retained  in its orb, will  be  recipro
cally  as D2.  This  will yet more  fully appear  from comparing  this  force
with  the  force  of gravity,  as is done  in the next  Proposition.
   COR.  If we augment  the mean  centripetal  force  by which  the moon  is
retained  in its orb,  first in the proportion  of 177%$  to 178ff,  and  then  in
the duplicate  proportion  of the semi-diameter  of the earth  to  the mean  dis
tance  of the centres  of the moon  and  earth, we  shall have  the  centripetal
force  of the moon  at the  surface  of  the  earth  ; supposing  this  force,  in de

scending  to the  earth's  surface, continually  to  increase  in  the  reciprocal
duplicate  proportion  of the height.

           PROPOSITION    IV.  THEOREM    IV.

 That  the moon  gravitates  towards  the earth, and  by thejorce  oj gravity
    is continually  drawn   off from  a  rectilinear  motion, and  retained  in
    its orbit.

   The  mean  distance  of the moon  from  the earth  in the syzygies  in  semi-
 diameters  of  the  earth,  is, according  to Ptolemy  and  most  astronomers,
 59  : according  to  Vendelin  and  Huygens,  60 ; to  Copernicus,  60 1 ; to
 Street, 60| ; and  to Tycho, 56|.  But  Tycho,  and  all that  follow  his  ta
 bles  of refraction, making  the refractions  of the sun  and moon  (altogether
 against  the nature  of light)  to exceed  the refractions  of the  fixed  stars, and
 that by four  or  five minutes  near  the  horizon,  did  thereby  increase  the

 moon's  horizontal  parallax  by a  like number  of minutes,  that  is, by  a
 twelfth  or fifteenth  part  of  the  whole  parallax.  Correct  this  error,  and
 the distance  will become  about  60^  semi-diameters  of  the  earth, near  to
 what  others  have  assigned.  Let  us assume  the mean  distance  of 60 diam
 eters  in the syzygies ; and  suppose  one  revolution  of the  moon,  in  respect
 of the  fixed  stars,  to be completed  in 27d.  7h. 43', as  astronomers  have  de
 termined  ; and  the circumference  of  the  earth  to amount  to 123249600
 Paris  feet, as the French  have  found  by mensuration.  And  now  if we
 imagine  the moon,  deprived  of all motion,  to be  let  go, so  as  to  descend
 towards  the earth with  the  impulse  of  all that  force  by which  (by Cor.
 Prop.  Ill) it is retained  in  its orb, it will in the space  of one  minute  of time,
 describe  in its fall 15T^  Paris  feet.  This  we  gather  by  a calculus, founded
 either upon  Prop. XXXVI,  Book   [, or (which  comes  to  the same  thing;
 upon  Cor.  9, Prop.  IV, of the same Book.  For  the  versed  sine  of that  arc,
 which  the moon,  in the space  of one  minute  of  time, would  by its mean

| shew), it is | here to be ne | glected. | The | action of t | he sun, att | racting the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| moon from | the earth, is | nearly as | the | moon's distance | from the | earth ; and |
| therefore ( | by what we ha | ve shewed | in | Cor. 2, Prop. | XLV. Book | I) i s to the |
| centripetal | force of the | moon as 2 | to | 357,45, or near | ly so ; that | is, a s 1 to |
| 178£ f- . | And if we negl | ect so inc | ons | iderable a for | ce of the | sun, the re |
| maining fo | rce, by which | the moon | is | retained in it | s orb, will | be recipro |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| cally as D | 2. This will | yet more | full | y appear from | comparing | this force |
| with the f | orce of gravity | , as is don | e i | n the next Prop | osition. |  |
| COR. If | we augment | the mean | cent | ripetal force | by which | the moon is |
| retained i | n its orb, first | in the pro | port | ion of 177%$ | to 178ff, | and then in |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the duplica | te proportion | of the se | mi-d | iameter of the | earth to t | he mean dis |
| tance of th | e centres of t | he moon a | nd | earth, we shall | have the | centripetal |
| force of th | e moon at the | surface o | f t | he earth ; supp | osing this | force, in de |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| scending t | o the earth's | surface, c | onti | nually to incr | ease in th | e reciprocal |
| duplicate | proportion of | the height. |  |  |  |  |

|  | PROPO | SITION | IV. | THEOREM | IV. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| That the | moon gravitat | es toward | s t | he earth, and | by thejorce | oj gravity |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The me | an distance o | f the moon | fr | om the earth i | n the syzygi | es in semi- |
| diameters | of the earth, | is, accord | ing | to Ptolemy | and most | astronomers, |
| 59 : accor | ding to Vend | elin and | Hu | ygens, 60 ; t | o Copernic | us, 60 1 ; t o |
| Street, 60 | | ; and to Tyc | ho, 56|. | Bu | t Tycho, and | all that fo | llow his ta |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| twelfth or | fifteenth par | t of the | who | le parallax. | Correct th | is error, and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the distan | ce will become | about 60 | ^ | semi-diameters | of the e | arth, near to |
| what other | s have assig | ned. Let | us a | ssume the mean | distance | of 60 diam |
| eters in th | e syzygies ; a | nd suppose | on | e revolution o | f the moon | , in respect |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the fixe | d stars, to be | completed | in | 27d. 7h. 43', as | astronome | rs have de |

| Paris fee | t, as the Frenc | h have f | oun | d by mensurat | ion. And | now if we |
| imagine t | he moon, depr | ived of all | mot | ion, to be le | t go, so as | to descend |

392            THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III

motion  describe  at the distance  of 60  seini-diameters  of the  earth,  is nearly
15^  Paris   feet, or more  accurately  15 feet, 1 inch, and  1 line £.  Where
fore, since  that  force, in approaching  to  the  earth, increases  in the recipro
cal duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance,  and, upon  that  account,  at  the
surface  of the  earth,  is 60 X  60  times  greater  than  at  the  moon,  a body
in our  regions,  falling with  that  force, ought  in the space  of one  minute  of
time,  to describe  60 X  60 X  15T]¥ Paris  feet;  and,  in the space  of  one  sec
ond  of time,  to describe  15 ,\ of those  feet;  or more  accurately  15  feet, 1
inch, and  1 line f .  And  with  this very  force  we  actually  find  that  bodies
here upon  earth  do  really descend  : for  a pendulum  oscillating  seconds  in
the latitude  of Paris  will  be 3 Paris  feet, and  8 lines  1 in length,  as Mr.
Hu.y veus  has  observed.  And  the  space  which  a heavy  body  describes
by falling  in one  second  of time  is to half  the length  of  this pendulum  in
the duplicate  ratio  of the circumference  of  a circie  to its diameter  (as Mr.
Htiy^ens  has  also shewn),  and  is therefore  15 Paris  feet, I inch,  1 line  J.
And  therefore  the  force by which  the moon   is retained  in  its orbit becomes,
at the very  surface  of the  earth, equal  to the  force  of gravity  which  we  ob
serve  in heavy  bodies  there.  And  therefore  (by Rule  I and  II) the force by
which  the moon   is retained  in  its orbit  is that  very same  force which  we
commonly   call gravity  ; for, were  gravity  another  force  different  from  that,
then  bodies  descending  to the earth  with  the joint impulse  of both  forces
would  fall with  a double  velocity,  and  in the space  of one  second  of time
would  describe  30^  Paris  feet ; altogether  against  experience.

   This  calculus  is founded  on  the hypothesis  of the  earth's  standing  still ;
for  if both  earth  and moon  move  about  the  sun.  and  at the same  time  about
 their common   centre  of gravity,  the  distance  of the centres  of the moon  and
earth  from  one  another  will  be 6(H  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  ; as may
be found  by  a computation  from  Prop. LX,  Book   I.

                      SCHOLIUM.

   The  demonstration  of this Proposition  may  be more  diffusely  explained
 after  the following manner.  Suppose  several  moons  to revolve  about  the
 earth,  as in the system  of Jupiter  or Saturn  : the  periodic  times  of these
 moons  (by the argument  of induction)  would  observe  the  same  law  which
 Kepler  found  to obtain among  the planets  ; and  therefore  their centripetal
 forces would  be reciprocally  as the squares  of the  distances  from  the centre
 of the  earth, by Prop.  I, of this Book.  Now  if the  lowest  of  these  were
 very  small, and  were  so near  the earth  as almost  to touo  the  tops  of  the
 highest  mountains,  the  centripetal  force  thereof, retaining  it in  its orb,
 would  be very  nearly  equal  to the weights  of any  terrestrial  bodies  that
 should  be found  upon  the tops  of  those  mountains,  as may  be known  by
 the foregoing computation.  Therefore  if the same  little moon  should  be
 deserted  by  its centrifugal  force  that  carries  it through  its orb, and  so be

| motion describ | e at the distance | of 60 seini-diam | eters of | the earth, | is nearly |
| 15^ Paris f | eet, or more accur | ately 15 feet, 1 | inch, and | 1 line £ | . Where |
| fore, since tha | t force, in approa | ching to the ea | rth, increa | ses in th | e recipro |
| cal duplicate | proportion of th | e distance, and, | upon tha | t accoun | t, at the |
| surface of the | earth, is 60 X 6 | 0 times greater | than at | the moo | n, a body |
| in our regions | , falling with tha | t force, ought i | n the spac | e of one | minute of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| time, to describ | e 60 X 60 X 15 | T]¥ Paris feet; | and, in th | e space | of one sec |
| ond of time, t | o describe 15 ,\ o | f those feet; or | more acc | urately | 15 feet, 1 |
| inch, and 1 li | ne f . And with | this very force | we actuall | y find t | hat bodies |
| here upon ear | th do really desce | nd : for a pend | ulum osci | llating | seconds in |
| the latitude o | f Paris will be 3 | Paris feet, and | 8 lines 1 | in leng | th, as Mr. |
| Hu.y veus ha | s observed. And | the space wh | ich a hea | vy body | describes |
| by falling in | one second of tim | e is to half the | length of | this pe | ndulum in |
| the duplicate | ratio of the circu | mference of a c | ircie to its | diamete | r (as Mr. |
| Htiy^ens has | also shewn), and | is therefore 15 | Paris fee | t, I inch | , 1 line J. |
| And therefore | the force by whi | ch the moon is | retained i | n its orbi | t becomes, |
| at the very su | rface of the earth | , equal to the f | orce of gra | vity whi | ch we ob |
| serve in heavy | bodies there. A | nd therefore (b | y Rule I a | nd II) t | he force by |
| which the moo | n is retained in | its orbit is that | very sam | e force | which we |
| commonly cal | l gravity ; f or, we | re gravity anot | her force d | ifferent | from that, |
| then bodies d | escending to the | earth with the j | oint impul | se of b | oth forces |
| would fall wit | h a double veloci | ty, and in the s | pace of o | ne secon | d of time |
| would describe | 30^ Paris feet | ; altogether aga | inst exper | ience. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| This calcul | us is founded on | the hypothesis | of the eart | h's stan | ding still ; |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| for if both ea | rth and moon mov | e about the sun | . and at t | he same | time about |

 lisabled  from  going onward  therein,  it would  descend  to  the  earth  ; and
that with  the same  velocity  as heavy  bodies  do actually  fall with  upo-n  the
tops  of those  very mountains  ; because  of the  equality  of the  forces  that
oblige them  both  to descend.  And  if the  force by which  that  lowest  moon
would  descend  were  different  from  gravity,  and  if that moon  were  to gravi
tate towards  the  earth,  as we  find  terrestrial  bodies  do upon  the  tops  of
mountains,  it would  then  descend  with  twice  the velocity,  as being  impel
led by both  these  forces conspiring  together.  Therefore  since  both  these
forces, that  is, the gravity  of heavy  bodies, and  the centripetal  forces  of the
moons,  respect  the  centre  of the earth, and  are  similar  and  equal  between
themselves,  they  will (by Rule  I and  II) have  one  and  the same  cause.  And
therefore  the force  which  retains  the moon  in  its orbit  is that  very  force
which  we commonly   call gravity  ; because  otherwise  this  little moon  at the
top  of  a mountain  must  either  be without  gravity,  or fall twice  as swiftly
as heavy  bodies  are  wont  to do.

must  be owing  to the same  sort  of  causes  ; especially  since  it has  been
demonstrated,  that  the  forces upon  which  those  revolutions  depend  tend  to
the  centres  of Jupiter,  of Saturn,  and  of the  sun  ; and  that  those  forces, in
receding  from  Jupiter, from  Saturn,  and  from  the  sun, decrease  in the same

                      SCHOLIUM.

  The  force which  retains  the  celestial  bodi «  in  their  orbits  has been
hitherto  called  centripetal  force;  but  it being now  made  plain  that  it can
be no  other  than  a gravitating  force, we  shall  hereafter  call  it gravity.
For  the cause  of that  centripetal  force which  retains  the moon  in  its orbit
will extend  itself  to all the  planets, by Rule  I, II, and  IV.

           PROPOSITION    VI.  THEOREM    VI.

That  all bodies  gravitate  towards  every planet ; and  that  the weights  of
   bodies  towards  any  the same  planet,  at equal  distances from  the centre
   of the planet,  are proportional  to the  quantities  of matter  which  they
   severally  contain.
   It has  been, now  of a long  time, observed  by others, that  all sorts  of
heavy  bodies  (allowance  being made  for the inequality  of retardation  which
they  suffer from  a small  power  of resistance  in  the  air) descend  to  the
earth from  equal  heights  in equal times;  and  that  equality  of  times  we
may  distinguish  to  a great  accuracy,  by the help  of pendulums.   I tried the
thing  in gold,  silver,  lead, glass, sand, eommpn   salt, wood,  water,  and  wheat.
I provided  two  wooden  boxes, round  and  equal : I filled the  one  with wood,
and  suspended  an  equal weight  of gold  (as exactly  as I could)  in the  centre
of oscillation  of the other.  The  boxes  hanging  by equal  threads  of 11  feet
made  a couple  of pendulums  perfectly  equal  in weight  and  figure, and
equally  receiving  the  resistance  of  the air.  And,  placing  the  one by the
other,  I observed  them  to play together  forward  and  backward,  for a long
time,  wi  h equal vibrations.  And  therefore  the quantity  of matte*  :n the
gold  (by Cor.  1 and  6, Prop. XXIV,  Book  II) was  to the quantity  ot mat
ter in the wood  as the action  of the motive  force  (or vis tnotrix)  upon  all
the gold  to the  action  of the same  upon  all the wood  ; that  is, as the weight
of the one  to the weight  of  the  other  : and  the  like happened  in the  other
bodies.  By  these experiments,  in bodies  of the same  weight,  1 could man
ifestly have  discovered  a difference  of matter  less than  the thousandth  part
of  the whol^,  had  any  such  been.  But, without  all doubt,  the  nature  of
gravity  towards  the planets  is the same  as towards  the earth.  For, should
we imagine  our  terrestrial  bodies  removed   to the  orb of the  moon,  and
there, together  with  the moon,  deprived  of all motion,  to be  let go,  so  as  to
fall together  towards  the  earth,  it is certain, from  what  we  have  demonstra
ted before,  that, in equal  times, they would  describe  equal  spaces  with  the
moon,  and  of consequence  are  to the  moon,  in quantity  of matter,  as  their
weights  to  its weight.  Moreover,  since  the  satellites  of Jupiter  perform

| gravity towards | the planets is th | e same as | towards th | e earth. For, | should |

their revolutions  in  times which  observe  the  sesquiphiate  pr  portion  ol

their  distances  from  Jupiter's  centre,  their  accelerative  gravities  towards
Jupiter  will  be reciprocally  as the squares  of their  distances  from  Jupiter's
centre;  that  is, equal, at  equal distances.  And,  therefore,  these  satellites,
if supposed  to fall towards  Jupiter  from  equal  heights, would  describe  equal
spaces  in  equal  times, in  like manner  as heavy  bodies  do  on  our  earth.
And,  by  the same  argument,  if the circumsolar  planets  were  supposed  to be
let fall  at equal  distances  from  the  sun, they would,  in their  descent  towards
the  sun, describe  equal  spaces  in  equal times.  But  forces which  equally
accelerate  unequal  bodies  must  be  as those  bodies  : that  is to  sa_y, the weights
;f  the  planets towards  the sun  must  be  as their  quantities  of  matter,
further,  that  the weights  of Jupiter  and  of  his satellites towards  the  sun
are  proportional  to the  several  quantities  of their  matter,  appears  from  the
exceedingly  regular  motions  of the  satellites  (by Cor.  3, Prop. LXV,  Book
1).  For  if some  of those  bodies  were  more  strongly  attracted  to  the sun  in
proportion  to their quantity  of matter  than  others,  the motions  of the  sat
ellites would  be disturbed  by that  inequality  of attraction  (by Cor.^,  Prop.
LXV,  Book  I).  If, at equal  distances  from  the  sun,  any  satellite,  in pro
portion  to the quantity  of its matter,  did gravitate  towards  the sun  with  a
force  greater  than  Jupiter  in proportion  to his, according  to any given  pro
portion,  suppose  of d  to  e ; then  the  distance  between  the centres  of the sun

and  of  the  satellite's  orbit would  be always  greater  than  the distance  be
tween  the  centres  of  the  sun  and  of Jupiter  nearly  in  the  subduplicate  of
that  proportion  : as by some  computations  I have found.  And  if the  sat
ellite did gravitate  towards  the sun  with  a force, lesser  in the proportion  of e
to d, the distance  of the  centre  of the  satellite's  orb from  the sun  would  be
less than  the distance  of  the  centre  of  Jupiter  from  the  sun  in the subdu
plicate of  the same  proportion.  Therefore  if, at equal  distances  from  the
sun,  the accelerative  gravity  of any  satellite  towards  the sun  were  greater
or less than  the accelerative  gravity  of Jupiter  towards  the sun  but by one  T oV 7
part  of the whole  gravity,  the distance  of  the  centre  of  the  satellite's  orbit
from  the  sun would  be greater  or  less than  the distance  of Jupiter  from  the
sun by one  ^oVo  Part  of the whole  distance;  that  is, by  a nf h part  of  the
distance  of the utmost  satellite from  the  centre  of Jupiter ; an  eccentricity
 of the  orbit which  would  be very  sensible.  But  the  orbits  of the  satellites
are concentric  to Jupiter,  and  therefore  the accelerative  gravities  of Jupiter,
and  of all its satellites towards  the  sun,  are  equal among  themselves.  And
by  the same  argument,  the weights  of Saturn  and  of  his satellites  towards
the  sun,  at equal  distances  from  the  sun,  are  as their  several  quantities  of
matter  ; and  the weights  of the moon  and  of the  earth  towards  the sun  are
either  none,  or accurately  proportional  to the masses  of matter  which  they
contain.  But  some  they  are, by Cor.  1 and  3, Prop.  V.
   But  further  ; the weights  of  all the parts  of every  planet  f awards  any  other

| Jupiter will be | reciprocally | as the | squares of th | eir distances fro | m Jupiter's |
| centre; that is | , equal, at e | qual dis | tances. And, | therefore, thes | e satellites, |
| if supposed to f | all towards | Jupiter | from equal h | eights, would des | cribe equal |
| spaces in equal | times, in | like ma | nner as hea | vy bodies do on | our earth. |
| And, by the sa | me argument | , if the | circumsolar | planets were sup | posed to be |
| let fall at equal | distances f | rom the | sun, they woul | d, in their desc | ent towards |
| the sun, descri | be equal sp | aces in | equal times. | But forces whi | ch equally |
| accelerate unequ | al bodies mu | st be as | those bodies | : t hat is to sa_y, | the weights |
| ;f the planets | towards t | he sun | must be as t | heir quantities | of matter, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| further, that | the weights | of Jupite | r and of his | satellites towar | ds the sun |
| are proportiona | l to the seve | ral quan | tities of thei | r matter, appear | s from the |
| exceedingly reg | ular motion | s of the | satellites (by | Cor. 3, Prop. L | XV, Book |
| 1). For if som | e of those b | odies we | re more stron | gly attracted to | the sun in |
| proportion to t | heir quantit | y of mat | ter than oth | ers, the motions | of the sat |
| ellites would b | e disturbed | by that | inequality of | attraction (by C | or.^, Prop. |
| LXV, Book I) | . If, at equ | al dista | nces from th | e sun, any satell | ite, in pro |
| portion to the | quantity of | its matte | r, did gravit | ate towards the | sun with a |
| force greater t | han Jupiter | in propo | rtion to his, | according to any | given pro |
| portion, suppose | of d to e ; | then th | e distance bet | ween the centres | of the sun |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and of the sat | ellite's orbit | would | be always gr | eater than the d | istance be |
| tween the centr | es of the su | n and o | f Jupiter nea | rly in the subd | uplicate of |
| that proportion | : as by som | e compu | tations I hav | e found. And | if the sat |

planet  are  one  to another  as the matter  in the  several  parts;  for  if some
parts  did gravitate  more,  others  less, than  for  the quantity  of their matter,
then  the whole  planet, according  to the  sort  of  parts  with  which  it most
abounds,  would  gravitate  more  or  less than  in proportion  to the quantity  of
matter  in the whole.  Nor  is it of any moment  whether  these  parts  are
external  or internal ; for  if, for example,  we  should  imagine  the terrestrial
bodies  with  us  to be raised up  to the  orb  of the moon,  to be there compared
with  its body  : if the weights  of such  bodies  were  to the weights  of the  ex
ternal  parts  of the moon  as the quantities  of matter  in the  one  and  in the

other  respectively  • but  to the weights  of the internal  parts  in  a greater  or
less proportion,  then  likewise  the weights  of those  bodies would  be  to  the
weight  of the whole  moon  in  a  greater  or  less proportion;  against  what

and  textures  ; for if the  weights  could  be  altered  with  the  forms,  they
would  be greater  or  less, according  to  the variety  of forms,  in equal matter  ;
altogether  against  experience.
   COR.  2. Universally,  all bodies  about  the  earth  gravitate  towards  the

earth  ; and  the weights  of all, at equal  distances  from  the  earth's  centre.
are  as the quantities  of matter  which  they  severally contain.  This  is the
quality  of all bodies  within  the reach  of our  experiments  ; and  therefore
(by Rule  III) to be affirmed  of all bodies whatsoever.   If the ather,  or anj
other  body,  were  either  altogether  void  of gravity,  or were  to gravitate  lesr
in proportion  to  its quantity  of  matter,  then, because  (according  to Aris
totle, Des  Carles,  and  others)  there  is no  difference  betwixt  that  and  other
bodies  but  in mere  form  of  matter, by  a successive  change  from  form  to
form,  it might  be changed  at last into a body  of  the  same  condition  with
those  which  gravitate  most  in proportion  to their  quantity  of matter  ; and,
on  the  other  hand,  the  heaviest  bodies, acquiring  the  first form  of  that
body, might  by degrees  quite  lose their gravity.  And  therefore  the weights
would  depend upon  the  forms  of  bodies, and  with  those  forms  might  be
changed  : contrary  to what  was  proved  in the preceding  Corollary.
   COR.  3. All  spaces  are  not  equally  full;  for  if all spaces  were  equally
full, then  the  specific gravity  of the  fluid which  fills the region  of  the  air,
on  account  of the extreme  density  of the  matter,  would  fall nothing  short
of the  specific gravity  of quicksilver,  or gold,  or any  other  the  most  dense
body  ; and,  therefore,  neither  gold, nor  any  other  body, could  descend  in
air ; for bodies  do not descend  in fluids, unless  they  are  specifically  heavier
than  the fluids.  And  if the quantity  of matter  in  a  given  space  can, by
any  rarefaction,  be  diminished,  what  should  hinder  a  diminution   to
infinity ?

BOOK Ill.J       OF   NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.      397

By  bodies  of the same  density,  I mean  those  whose  vires  inertia  are in the
proportion  of their  bulks.
   COR.  5. The  power  of gravity  is of a different  nature  from  the power  of
magnetism  ; for the magnetic  attraction  is not  as the  matter  attracted.
Some  bodies  are  attracted  more  by the magnet  ; others  less ; most  bodies
not  at all.  The  power  of magnetism  in one  and  the same  body may  be
increased  and  diminished  ; and  is sometimes  far stronger,  for the quantity
of matter,  than  the power  of gravity  ; and  in receding  from  the magnet
decreases  not  in the duplicate  but almost  in the  triplicate proportion  of the
distance,  as nearly  as I could  judge  from  some  rude  observations.

          PROPOSITION    VII.  THEOREM    VII.

That  there  is a power  of gravity  tending  to all  bodies, proportional  to
   the several  quantities  of matter  which  they contain.
   That  all the planets mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  we have
proved  before  ; as well  as that  the  force  of gravity  towards  every  one  of them,
considered  apart,  is reciprocally  as the square  of the distance  of places from
the  centre  of  the planet.  And  thence  (by Prop. LXIX,  Book  I, and  its
Corollaries)  it follows,  that  the gravity  tending  towards  all the planets  is
proportional  to the matter  which  they  contain.
   Moreover,  since  all the  parts  of any  planet A  gravitate  towards  any
other  planet  B  ; and  the  gravity  of  every  part  is to  the  gravity  of  the
whole  as the matter  of the part  to the matter  of the whole  ; and  (by Law
III) to every  action  corresponds  an  equal  re-action  ; therefore  the planet B
will, on  the other  hand,  gravitate  towards  all the  parts  of the  planet A ;
and  its gravity  towards  any  one  part  will be  to the  gravity  towards  the
whole  as  the matter  of the part  to the matter  of the whole.  Q.E.D.
   COR,  1. Therefore  the  force  of gravity  towards  any  whole  planet  arises
from, and  is compounded   of, the  forces  of gravity towards  all  its parts.
Magnetic  and  electric  attractions  afford  us  examples  of  this ; for  all at
traction  towards  the whole  arises from  the  attractions  towards  the  several
parts.  The  thing may  be  easily understood  in  gravity,  if we  consider  a
greater  planet,  as formed  of a number  of lesser  planets, meeting  together  in
one  globe ; for hence  it would  appear  that  the  force  of  the whole  must
arise from  the  forces  of the component  parts.  If  it is objected,  that,  ac
cording  to this  law, all bodies  with  us  must  mutually  gravitate  one  to
wards  another,  whereas  no such  gravitation  any  where  appears,  I answer,
that  since  the gravitation  towards  these  bodies  is to the gravitation  towards
the whole  earth  as  these  bodies  are  to the whole  earth, the  gravitation  to
wards  them  must  be far  less than  to fall under  the observation  of our  senses.
   COR.  2. The  force  of gravity  towards  the several  equal  particles  of any
body  is reciprocally  as the square  of the distance  of places from  the  parti
cles ; as appears  from  Cor.  3, Prop. LXXIV,  Book  I.

39S           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK   III


          PROPOSITION    VIII.  THEOREM     VIII.

 Tn two  spheres mutually  gravitating  each  towards  the other, if tlie matter
   in places  on  all sides round  about  and  equi-distant from  the centres  is
   similar,  the weight  of either  sphere  towards  the other  will  be recipro
   cally as  the square  of the distance  between  their  centres.
   After  I had  found  that  the  force  of gravity  towards  a whole  planet  did
arise from  and  was  compounded   of  the  forces  of gravity  towards  all  its
parts, and  towards  every  one  part was  in the reciprocal  proportion  of  the
squares  of the distances  from  the  part, I was  yet in doubt  whether  that  re
ciprocal  duplicate  proportion  did accurately  hold, or but  nearly  so, in the
total  force compounded  of so many  partial ones;  for  it might  be  that  the
proportion  which  accurately  enough  took  place  in greater  distances  should
be wide  of the truth  near  the surface  of  the planet, where  the distances  of
the  particles  are  unequal,  and  their  situation  dissimilar.    But  by the help
of Prop. LXXV   and LXXVI,  Book  I, and  their  Corollaries,  I was  at last
satisfied  of the  truth  of the Proposition,  as it now  lies before  us.
   COR.  1. Hence  we may  find and compare  together  the weights  of bodies
towards  different  planets ; for the weights  of bodies  revolving  in  circles
about  planets  are  (by Cor.  2, Prop.  IV, Book  I) as  the diameters  of  the
circles  directly, and  the squares  of  their  periodic  times  reciprocally  ; and
their weights  at the surfaces  of the  planets,  or  at any  other  distances  from
their  centres,  are (by  this Prop.)  greater  or less in the reciprocal  duplicate
proportion  of the distances.  Thus  from  the  periodic  times  of Venus,  re
volving  about  the  sun, in 224<J. 16fh,  of the  utmost  circumjovial  satellite
revolving  about  Jupiter,  in 16'.  10  -?/. ; of the Huygenian  satellite  about
Saturn  in  15d. 22f h. ; and  of  the moon  about  the  earth  in  27d.  7h. 43' ;
compared  with  the mean  distance  of Venus  from  the  sun, and  with  the
greatest  heliocentric  elongations  of  the  outmost  circumjovial  satellite
from  Jupiter's  centre,  8' 16";  of the Huygenian  satellite from  the  centre
of Saturn,  3' 4"  ; arid  of the moon  from  the  earth,  10' 33"  : by computa
tion  I found  that  the weight  of equal  bodies,  at equal  distances  from  the
centres  of the  sun,  of Jupiter,  of Saturn,  and  of the earth, towards  the  sun,
Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  the  earth, were  one  to another,  as 1, T^VT>  ^oVr?  an^
 ___i___  respectively.  Then  because  as the distances  are  increased  or  di
minished,  the weights  are diminished  or  increased  in a duplicate  ratio, the
weights  of equal  bodies  towards  the  sun,  Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  the  earth,
at the distances  10000,  997, 791, and  109  from  their  centres,  that  is, at their
very  superficies,  will  be  as  10000,  943, 529, and  435  respectively. How
much  the weights  of bodies  are  at  the  superficies  of  the  moon,  will be

planets;  for  their  quantities  of matter  are  as  the forces  of gravity  at equai
distances  from  their  centres;  that  is, in the  sun, Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  the
earth, as  1, TO'FTJ  a-oVr? anc^ TeVaja  respectively.  If  the parallax  of  the
sun  be  taken  greater  or  less than  10"  30'",  the quantity  of  matter  in
the earth  must  be augmented  or  diminished  in the  triplicate of  that  pro
portion.
   COR.  3. Hence  also we  find  the  densities  of  the planets ; for (by Prop.
LXXII,  Book  I) the weights  of equal and  similar  bodies towards  similar
spheres  are,  at the surfaces  of those  spheres,  as the diameters  of the spheres  5
and  therefore  the  densities  of dissimilar  spheres  are  as those weights  applied
to the diameters  of the spheres.  But  the  true diameters  of the Sun,  .Jupi
ter, Saturn,  and  the  earth, were  one  to  another  as  10000,  997,  791,  arid
109;  and  the weights  towards  the same  as 10000,  943,  529, and 435   re
spectively  ; and  therefore  their  densities  are  as  100. 94|,  67, and 400.  The
density  of the  earth, which  comes  out by this computation,  does  not depend
upon  the parallax  of  the  sun, but  is determined  by the  parallax  of  the
moon,  and  therefore  is here  truly defined.  The  sun,  therefore,  is a little
denser  than  Jupiter,  and  Jupiter  than  Saturn,  and  the  earth  four  times
denser  than  the  sun ; for the  sun, by its great  heat,  is kept  in  a sort  of
a rarefied  state.  The  moon  is denser  than  the  earth,  as  shall appear  after
ward.
   COR.  4. The  smaller  the  planets  are, they  are,  cccteris parilms,  of  so
much  the greater  density ; for  so  the powers  of gravity  on  their  several
surfaces  come  nearer  to equality.  They  are  likewise,  cccteris  paribiis,  of
the  greater  density,  as  they are  nearer  to the sun.  So  Jupiter  is more
dense  than  Saturn,  and  the  earth  than  Jupiter ; for the planets  were  to be
placed  at different  distances  from  the  sun,  that, according  to their  degrees
of density,  they might  enjoy  a greater  or  less proportion  to the sun's  heat.
Our  water,  if  it were  removed  as far  as the  orb of  Saturn,  would  be  con
verted  into  ice, and  in  the  orb of Mercury  would  quickly  fly away  in va
pour  ; for the  light of the  sun,  to which   its heat  is proportional,  is seven
times  denser  in the  orb  of Mercury  than  with  us  : and  by the thermometer
I have  found  that  a sevenfold  heat  of  our summer   sun  will make  water
boil.  Nor  are  we  to doubt  that  the  matter  of Mercury  is adapted  to  its

therefore, can  be no  greater  than  what  may  arise from  the  inequality  of
the  density.

            PROPOSITION    X.  THEOREM   X.

 That  the motions  of the planets  in  the heavens  may  subsist  an exceedingly
                                  long  time.
   In the Scholium  of  Prop. XL,  Book  II, I have  shewed  that  a globe  of
water  frozen  into  ice, and  moving  freely  in our  air, in  the time  that  it would
describe  the length  of  its semi-diameter,  would  lose by the resistance  of the
air ¥3\6  part of  its motion;  and  the same  proportion  holds  nearly  in  all
globes, how  great  soever,  and  moved  with  whatever  velocity.  But  that  our
globe  of  earth  is of  greater  density  than  it would  be  if the  whole
consisted  of water  only, I thus make  out.  If the whole  consisted  of
water  only, whatever  was  of  less  density  than  water, because  of  its  Ivss
specific gravity, would  emerge  and  float above.  And  upon  this account,  if
a globe  of terrestrial  matter,  covered  on  all sides with  water, was  less dense
than  water,  it would  emerge  somewhere  ; and, the  subsiding  water  falling
back, would  be  gathered  to the opposite  side.  And  such  is the  condition
of our  earth, which  in  a great measure  is covered  with  seas.  The  earth,  if
it was  not  for  its greater  density, would  emerge  from  the  seas,  and, accord
ing  to its degree  of levity, would  be raised  more  or  less above  their  surface,
the water  of the seas flowing backward  to the opposite  side.  By  the same
argument,  the spots of  the sun, which  float upon  the  lucid matter  thereof.
are lighter than  that  matter  ; and, however  the planets  have  been  formed
while  they  were  yet in fluid  masses,  all the  heavier  matter  subsided  to the
centre.  Since,  therefore,  the common  matter  of  our  earth  on  the  surface
thereof  is about  twice  as heavy  as water, and  a  little  lower,  in mines,  is
found  about  three,  or four, or even  five times  more  heavy,  it is probable  that
the  quantity  of  the whole  matter  of  the  earth may  be five  or six  times
greater  than  if it consisted  all of water  ; especially  since  I have  before
shewed  that  the  earth  is about  four  times  more  dense  than Jupiter.  If,
therefore,  Jupiter  is a little more  dense  than  water,  in the space  of  thirty
days,  in which  that planet  describes  the length  of 459  of  its semi-diame
ters,  it would,  in  a medium  of the same  density  Avith  our  air, lose almost  a
tenth  part  of  its motion.  But  since  the  resistance  of mediums  decreases
in proportion  to their weight  or density,  so that  water,  which  is 13|  times
lighter than  quicksilver,  resists  less in that  proportion  ; and  air, which  is
860  times  lighter  than  water,  resists  less in the same  proportion  ; therefore
in the heavens,  where  the weight  of the medium   in which  the planets move
is immensely  diminished,  the  resistance  will almost  vanish.
   It is shewn  in the Scholium  of Prop. XXII,  Book  II, that  at the height
of 200  miles  above  the earth  the air  is more  rare  than  it is at the super
ficies of  the  earth  in  the  ratio  of 30  to 0,0000000000003999,  or  as

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| That the motions | of the planets i | n the h | eavens may s | ubsist an | exceedingly |
|  | l | ong ti | me. |  |  |
| In the Scholi | um of Prop. XL, | Book | II, I have s | hewed tha | t a globe of |
| water frozen into | ice, and moving | freely | in our air, in | the time t | hat it would |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| describe the leng | th of its semi-dia | meter, | would lose b | y the resis | tance of the |
| air ¥3\6 part of | its motion; and | the s | ame proporti | on holds n | early in all |
| globes, how great | soever, and move | d wit | h whatever ve | locity. B | ut that our |
| globe of earth | is of greater de | nsity | than it wou | ld be if | the whole |
| consisted of wat | er only, I thus | make | out. If th | e whole | consisted of |
| water only, what | ever was of less | dens | ity than water | , because | of its Ivss |
| specific gravity, | would emerge and | float | above. And | upon this | account, if |
| a globe of terrest | rial matter, cover | ed on | all sides with | water, wa | s less dense |
| than water, it wo | uld emerge som | ewhere | ; and, the s | ubsiding w | ater falling |
| back, would be | gathered to the o | pposit | e side. And | such is t | he condition |
| of our earth, whi | ch in a great mea | sure | is covered wit | h seas. T | he earth, if |
| it was not for its | greater density, | would | emerge from | the seas, | and, accord |
| ing to its degree | of levity, would | be rais | ed more or le | ss above t | heir surface, |
| the water of the | seas flowing back | ward | to the opposit | e side. | By the same |
| argument, the sp | ots of the sun, w | hich | float upon the | lucid mat | ter thereof. |
| are lighter than | that matter ; and | , howe | ver the plane | ts have | been formed |
| while they were | yet in fluid masse | s, all | the heavier | matter sub | sided to the |
| centre. Since, t | herefore, the com | mon | matter of our | earth on | the surface |
| thereof is about | twice as heavy | as wat | er, and a lit | tle lower, | in mines, is |
| found about three | , or four, or even | five t | imes more hea | vy, it is p | robable that |
| the quantity of | the whole matte | r of | the earth may | be five o | r six times |
| greater than if | it consisted all | of wa | ter ; especiall | y since I | have before |
| shewed that the | earth is about f | our ti | mes more den | se than J | upiter. If, |
| therefore, Jupiter | is a little more | dense | than water, | in the spac | e of thirty |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| days, in which th | at planet describ | es the | length of 45 | 9 of its | semi-diame |
| ters, it would, in | a medium of the | same | density Avith | our air, l | ose almost a |
| tenth part of its | motion. But si | nce th | e resistance | of medium | s decreases |
| in proportion to | their weight or d | ensity, | so that water | , which i | s 13| times |
| lighter than quic | ksilver, resists le | ss in | that proporti | on ; and a | ir, which is |
| 860 times lighter | than water, resis | ts less | in the same | proportion | ; t herefore |
| in the heavens, w | here the weight o | f the | medium in wh | ich the pl | anets move |
| is immensely dim | inished, the resis | tance | will almost v | anish. |  |
| It is shewn in | the Scholium of | Prop. | XXII, Book | II, that at | the height |

 75000000000000   to 1 nearly.  And  hence  the planet  Jupiter, revolving  in
 a medium  of the same  density  with  that  superior  air, would  not  lose by the
 resistance  of  the medium  the 1000000th  part of  its motion  in 1000000
 years.  In the spaces  near  the earth  the resistance  is produced  only by the
 air, exhalations,  and vapours.  When  these  are  carefully  exhausted  by the
 air-pump  from  under  the  receiver, heavy  bodies  fall within  the  receiver  with
 perfect freedom,  and  without  the  le.ist sensible  resistance:  gold  itself, and
 the lightest  down,  let fall together,  will  descend  with  equal  velocity;  and
 though  they  fall through  a space  of four,  six, and  eight  feet, they  will come
 to the bottom  at the same  time;  as appears  from  experiments.  And  there
 fore  the  celestial  regions  being  perfectly  void  of  air and  exhalations,  the
 planets  and  comets  meeting  no  sensible  resistance  in those  spaces  will  con
 tinue  their motions  through  them  for an immense  tract  of time.

                  HYPOTHESIS    I.

         That  the  centre  of the system  of the world  is immovable.
   This   is  acknowledged    by    all,  while   some   contend    that   the   earth,
others  that  the  sun, is fixed  in  that  centre.    Let  us  see what  may  from
hence  follow.

           PROPOSITION   XL   THEOREM   XI.

 That  the common,  centre  of gravity  of the  earth,  the  sun, and  all  the
                             planets,  is immovable.
   For  (by Cor.  4 of  the Laws)  that  centre  either  is at  rest, or moves  uni
formly  forward  in  a right  line ; but  if that  centre  moved,  the centre  of the
world  would  move  also, against  the Hypothesis.

          PROPOSITION    XII.  THEOREM   XII.

 That  the sun  is agitated  by  a perpetual  motion,  but  never  recedes jar
        from  the common,  centre  of gravity  of all  the planets.
   For  since  (by Cor.  2, Prop.  VIII)  the quantity  of matter  in the sun  is to
the quantity  of matter  in Jupiter  as 1067  to 1 ; and  the distance  of Jupi
ter from  the  sun  is to  the semi-diameter  of  the  sun  in  a proportion  but  a
small  matter  greater,  the common  centre  of gravity  of Jupiter  and  the sun
will  fall upon  a point  a little without  the surface  of the sun.  By  the same
argument,  since  the  quantity  of matter  in  the  sun  is to the  quantity  of
matter  in Saturn  as 3021  to 1, and  the distance  of Saturn  from  the sun  is
to the  semi-diameter  of  the sun  in  a proportion  but  a  small  matter  less,
the common  centre  of gravity  of Saturn  and  the  sun  will  fall upon  a point
a little within  the surface  of the sun.  And, pursuing  the  principles  of this
computation,  we  should  find  that though  the earth  and  all the  planets  were
placed  on  one  side  of the  sun, the distance  of the common  centre  of gravity
of all from  the centre  of the sun  would  scarcely amount  to one diameter  of
                                    26

the sun.  In other  cases, the distances  of those  centres  are always  less  : and
therefore,  since  that  centre  of  gravity  is in perpetual  rest, the  sun,  accord
ing  to the various  positions  of the  planets, must  perpetually  be moved  every
way,  but  will never  recede  far from  that  centre.
   Con.  Hence  the common  centre  of gravity  of the  earth,  the  sun, and  all
the planets,  is to be esteemed  the centre  of  the world ; for since  the  earth,
the sun,  and  all the  planets, mutually  gravitate  one  towards  another,  and
are  therefore,  according  to their  powers  of  gravity,  in perpetual  agitation,
as the Laws  of Motion  require,  it is plain  that  their moveable  centres  can
not  be taken  for the immovable  centre  of  the world.   If that body  were  to
be placed  in the  centre,  towards  which  other  bodies  gravitate  most  (accord
ing  to common   opinion),  that  privilege  ought  to be allowed  to the sun;  but
since  the sun  itself  is moved,  a fixed point  is to be chosen  from  which  the
centre  of  the  sun  recedes  least, and  from  which  it would  recede  yet
less  if the body  of  the sun  were  denser  and  greater,  and  therefore  less apt
to be moved.

          PROPOSITION   XIII.  THEOREM   XIII.

The  planets  move  in ellipses  tvhicli have  their common  focus  in the  centre
   of the  sini  ; and, by radii  drawn,  to tJtat centre, they describe  areas pro
   portion  al  to the times  of description.
  We  have  discoursed  above  of these motions  from  the Phenomena.  Now
that we know  the  principles  on  which  they depend, from  those  principles
we  deduce  the motions  of  the  heavens  a priori.  Because  the weights  of
the planets  towards  the sun  are  reciprocally  as the squares  of their  distan

ces from  the  sun's  centre,  if the sun  was  at  rest, and  the  other  planets  did
not mutually  act one  upon  another,  their  orbits would  be  ellipses, having
the sun  in their common  focus;  and  they would  describe  areas  proportional
to  the  times  of description,  by Prop.  I and  XI, and  Cor.  1, Prop.  XIII,
Book  I.  But  the mutual  actions  of  the planets  one  upon  another  are  so
very  small,  that they may  be neglected  ; and  by Prop. LXVI,  Book  I, they
less disturb  the  motions  of  the planets  around  the  sun  in motion  than  if
those motions  were  performed  about  the sun  at  rest.
    It is true,  that  the action  of Jupiter  upon  Saturn  is not  to be neglected;
for  the force  of gravity  towards  Jupiter  is to the  force  of gravity  towards
the sun  (at equal  distances,  Cor.  2, Prop.  VIII)  as 1 to 1067;  and  therefore
in the conjunction  of Jupiter  and  Saturn,  because  the  distance  of  Saturn
from  Jupiter  is to the distance  of Saturn  from  the sun  almost  as 4  to 9, the
gravity  of Saturn  towards  Jupiter  will  be  to the gravity  of Saturn  towards
the sun  as 81  to 16 X  1067;  or, as 1 to about  21 1.  And  hence  arises  a
perturbation  of the  orb  of Saturn  in every  conjunction  of  this planet  with
Tupiter,  so  sensible,  that astronomers  are  puzzled  with  it.  As  the  planet

| the sun. In | other cases, the di | stances | of those c | entres are alwa | ys less : and |
| therefore, sin | ce that centre of | gravity | is in perp | etual rest, the | sun, accord |
| ing to the va | rious positions of | the pla | nets, must | perpetually be | moved every |
| way, but will | never recede far | from th | at centre. |  |  |
| Con. Henc | e the common cen | tre of | gravity of | the earth, the | sun, and all |
| the planets, | is to be esteemed t | he cent | re of the | world ; f or sin | ce the earth, |
| the sun, and | all the planets, m | utually | gravitate | one towards | another, and |
| are therefore, | according to thei | r power | s of gravi | ty, in perpetua | l agitation, |
| as the Laws | of Motion require, | it is p | lain that t | heir moveable | centres can |
| not be taken | for the immovable | centre | of the wo | rld. If that | body were to |
| be placed in | the centre, towards | which | other bodi | es gravitate m | ost (accord |
| ing to commo | n opinion), that p | rivilege | ought to | be allowed to | the sun; but |
| since the sun | itself is moved, | a fixed | point is to | be chosen fro | m which the |

| The planets | move in ellipses t | vhicli h | ave their c | ommon focus | in the centre |
| of the sini | ; and, by radii dr | awn, t | o tJtat centr | e, they describ | e areas pro |
| portion al t | o the times of des | cription | . |  |  |
| We have d | iscoursed above of | these | motions fr | om the Phenom | ena. Now |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that we know | the principles o | n which | they depe | nd, from thos | e principles |
| we deduce th | e motions of the | heaven | s a priori | . Because th | e weights of |
| the planets t | owards the sun are | recipr | ocally as t | he squares of | their distan |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ces from the | sun's centre, if th | e sun w | as at rest, | and the other | planets did |
| not mutually | act one upon an | other, | their orbits | would be elli | pses, having |
| the sun in th | eir common focus; | and t | hey would | describe areas | proportional |
| to the times | of description, b | y Prop. | I and XI | , and Cor. 1, | P rop. XIII, |
| Book I. But | the mutual acti | ons of | the planet | s one upon ano | ther are so |
| very small, t | hat they may be n | eglected | ; and by | Prop. LXVI, | Book I, t hey |
| less disturb | the motions of th | e plane | ts around | the sun in mo | tion than if |
| those motions | were performed | about t | he sun at r | est. |  |
| It is true, | that the action of | Jupiter | upon Satu | rn is not to b | e neglected; |
| for the force | of gravity towards | Jupit | er is to the | force of grav | ity towards |
| the sun (at e | qual distances, Cor | . 2, P ro | p. VIII) as | 1 to 1067; a | nd therefore |
| in the conjun | ction of Jupiter | and Sa | turn, becau | se the distance | of Saturn |
| from Jupiter | is to the distance | of Satu | rn from th | e sun almost a | s 4 to 9, t he |
| gravity of Sa | turn towards Jupi | ter will | be to the | gravity of Sat | urn towards |
| the sun as 81 | to 16 X 1067; | or, as | 1 to about | 21 1. And he | nce arises a |

is differently  situated  in  these  conjunctions,  its eccentricity  is sometimes
augmented,  sometimes  diminished;  its aphelion  is sometimes  carried  for
ward, sometimes  backward,  and  its mean  motion  is by turns  accelerated  and
retarded  ; yet  the whole  error  in  its motion  about  the  sun, though  arising
from  so great  a force, may  be almost  avoided  (except  in the mean  motion)
by placing  the lower  focus  of its orbit  in the common  centre  of  gravity  of
Jupiter  and  the sun (according  to Prop. LXVII,  Book   I), and  therefore  that
error, when  it  is greatest,  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  ; and  the greatest
error  in the mean  motion  scarcely  exceeds  two  minutes  yearly.  But  in the
conjunction  of Jupiter  and  Saturn,  the accelerative  forces  of gravity  of the
sun  towards  Saturn,  of Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  and  of Jupiter  towards  the


sun,  are almost  as 16, 81, and  -     ~o^~~      —  > or 156609:  and  therefore
the difference  of  the  forces  of  gravity  of  the sun  towards  Saturn,  and  of
Jupiter  towards  Saturn,  is to the  force  of gravity  of Jupiter  towards  the
sun  as 65  to 156609,  or  as 1 to 2409.  But  the  greatest  power  of Saturn
to disturb  the  motion  of Jupiter  is proportional  to this  difference;  and
therefore  the perturbation  of the  orbit  of Jupiter  is much  less than  that  of

Saturn's.  The  perturbations  of the  other  orbits  are  yet far  less, except  that
the  orbit of  the earth  is sensibly disturbed  by the moon.  The  common
centre  of gravity  of the earth  and moon  moves  in an  ellipsis about  the sun
in the focus  thereof,  and, by  a radius  drawn  to the sun, describes  areas  pro
portional  to the times  of description.  But  the  earth  in the mean  time by
a menstrual  motion  is revolved  about  this common   centre.

          PROPOSITION   XIV.   THEOREM   XIV.

      The  aphelions  and  nodes  of the  orbits  of the planets  are fixed.

  The  aphelions  are immovable  by  Prop. XI, Book  I ; and  so  are  the
planes  of the  orbits, by Prop.  I of  the same Book.  And  if the planes  are
fixed, the  nodes  must  be  so too.  It is true, that some  inequalities may
arise from  the mutual  actions  of  the  planets  and  comets  in their  revolu

   COR.  1. The  fixed  stars  are immovable,  seeing  they keep  the same  posi

   COR.  2. And  since  these  stars  are  liable  to no  sensible  parallax  from  the
annual  motion  of  the  earth, they can  have  no  force, because  of  their im

therefore  their  aphelions  and  nodes  must  be  fixed, excepting  in so far  as
they  are disturbed  by the actions  of Jupiter  and  Saturn,  and  other  higher
bodies.  And  hence  we may  find, by the theory  of gravity,  that  their aphe

          PROPOSITION   XVII.  THEOREM   XV.

That   the diurnal  motions  of the planets  are  uniform,  and  that  the
           libration  of the moon  arises from  its diurnal  motion.
  The  Proposition  is proved  from  the  first Law  of  Motion,  and  Cor.  22,
Prop. LXVI,  Book  I.  Jupiter,  with  respect  to the  fixed  stars, revolves  in
9'1. 5(5 ; Mars  in 24h.  39' ; Venus  in about  23h. ; the Earth  in  23'1. 56' ; the
Sun  in 25 1 days, and  the  moon  in 27  days, 7 hours, 43'.  These  things
appear  by the Phasnomena.  The  spots  in  the  sun's  body  return  to  the
same  situation  on  the  sun's  disk, with  respect  to the  earth,  in 27 ± days ; and
therefore  with  respect  to the fixed  stars  the  sun  revolves  in about  25|days.
But  because  the  lunar  day, arising from  its uniform  revolution  about  its
axis, is menstrual,  that  is, equal  to  the  time  of its periodic  revolution  in
its orb, therefore  the same  face  of the moon   wrill be always  nearly  turned  to
the upper  focus  of its orb ; but, as the situation  of that  focus  requires,  will
deviate  a little to  one  side and  to the  other  from  the  earth  in the lower
focus  j and  this  is the  libration  in longitude ; for the libration  in latitude
arises from  the moon's  latitude,  and  the inclination  of its axis  to the plane
of the ecliptic.  This  theory  of the  libration  of the moon,  Mr.  N. Mercato*

in his Astronomy,  published  at the beginning  of  the year  1676.  explained
more  fully out  of  the  letters  I sent him.  The  utmost  satellite of  Saturn
eeems  to revolve  about  its axis with  a motion  like  this  of the moon,  respect
ing Saturn  continually  with  the same  face;  for in  its revolution  round
Saturn,  as often  as  it comes  to the  eastern  part  of  its orbit,  it is scarcel)
visible, and  generally  quite  disappears  ; which  is like  to be  occasioned  by
some  spots  in that  part  of its body, which  is then  turned  towards  the  earth,
as M. Cassini  has observed.  So  also  the utmost  satellite  of Jupiter  seema
to revolve  about  its axis with  a like motion,  because  in that part  of its body
which  is turned  from  Jupiter  it has  a spot, which  always  appears  as if it

were  in Jupiter's own  body, whenever  the  satellite  passes between  Jupiter
and  our  eye.

         PROPOSITION   XVIII.   THEOREM   XVI.

 That  the axes  of the planets  are  less than  the diameters  drawn  perpen
                             dicular  to the  axes.

  The  equal gravitation  of the parts  on  all sides would  give  a  spherical
figure  to the planets,  if it was  not  for their  diurnal  revolution  in  a  circle.
By  that  circular  motion  it comes  to pass  that  the parts receding  from  the
axis endeavour  to ascend  about  the equator  ; and  therefore  if the matter  is
in a fluid  state, by  its ascent  towards  the equator  it will  enlarge  the  di

ameters  there, and  by  its descent'  to wards  the  poles  it will shorten  the  axis.
So  the diameter  of Jupiter  (by the concurring  observations  of astronomers)
is found  shorter  betwixt  pole and  pole  than  from  east  to west.  And, by
the same  argument,  if our  earth  was  not higher  about  the equator  than  at
the  poles, the  seas would  subside  about  the  poles, and, rising toward*  Ikf
equator,  would  lay  all things  there  under  water.

llf".  Hence  an  arc  of one  degree  appears  to be 57061  Paris   toises.
And  from  these measures  we  conclude  that  the circumference  of  the earth

is 123249600,  and  its semi-diameter  19615800  Paris  feet, upon  the  sup
position  that  the  earth  is of  a spherical  figure.
   In  the latitude  of Paris  a heavy  body  falling in  a  second  of time  de
scribes  15 Paris  feet, 1 inch, 1 J line, as above,  that  is, 2173  lines J.  The
weight  of the body  is diminished  by the weight  of  the ambient  air.  Let

us suppose  the weight  lost thereby  to be  TT^o-o-  Par^  °^  ^he whole  weight  ;
then  that heavy  body  falling  in, vacua  will  describe  a height  of 2174  lines
in one  second  of time.

  A  body  in every  sidereal  day  of  23'1. 56' 4" uniformly  revolving  in  a
circle  at the  distance  of 19615SOO  feet from  the  centre,  in one  second  oi
time  describes  an  arc  of 1433,46  feet ; the versed  sine  of which  is 0,0523656  1
feet, or 7,54064  lines.  And  therefore  the force  with  which  bodies  descend
in the latitude  of Paris  is to the centrifugal  force of  bodies  in the equator
arising from  the diurnal  motion  of the earth  as 2174  to 7,54064.
  The  centrifugal  force  of bodies  in the equator  is to the centrifugal  force
with  which  bodies  recede  directly from  the  earth  in the  latitude  of Parin

48°  50' 10"  in the duplicate  proportion  of the radius  to the cosine  of  the
latitude,  that  is, as 7,54064  to 3,267.  Add  this force  to the  force  with
which  bodies  descend  by their weight  in the  latitude  of Paris,  and  a body,
in the latitude  of Paris,  falling by its whole  undiminished  force  of gravity,
in the time  of one  second,  will  describe 2177,267  lines, or 15  Paris   feet,
1 inch, and  5,267  lines.  And  the total  force  of gravity  in  that  latitude
will  be  to the centrifugal  force  of bodies  in  the  equator  of the  earth  as
2177,267  to 7,54064,  or  as 289  to  1.
                    Wherefore  if APBQ,  represent  the  figure of  the
                        earth, now  no  longer  spherical,  but  generated  by the
                      rotation  of an  ellipsis about  its lesser  axis  PQ,  ; and
                ACQqca   a canal  full  of water,  reaching  from  the pole
                  Qq  to the centre  Cc, and  thence  rising  to the  equator
                          Art ; the weight  of the water  in the leg of the  canal
                  ACca   will be  to  the weight  of water  in  the  other  leg
QCcq  as 289  to 288, because  the centrifugal  force  arising from  the  circu
lar motion  sustains  and  takes  off one  of the 289  parts  of the weight  (in the
one  leg), and  the weight  of 288  in the  other  sustains  the  rest.  But  by
computation  (from  Cor.  2, Prop. XCI,  Book  I) I find, that, if the  matter
of the  earth was  all uniform,  and  without  any  motion,  and  its axis PQ,
were  to  the  diameter  AB  as 100  to  101, the  force  of gravity  in  the

place Q  towards  the  earth  would  be  to the  force  of gravity  in the same
place Q  towards  a sphere  described  about  the  centre C  with  the  radius
PC,  or QC,  as 126  to 125.  And,  by the same  argument,  the  force  of
gravity  in the place A  towards  the spheroid  generated  by the  rotation  of

the  ellipsis APBQ,  about  the axis AI3  is to  the  force  of gravity  in  the
same  place A, towards  the sphere  described  about  the  centre  C  with  the
radius AC,  as 125  to 126.  But  the  force  of gravity  in  the  place A  to
wards  the earth  is a mean  proportional  betwixt  the  forces  of gravity  to
wards  the spheroid  and  this sphere;  because  the  sphere, by having  its  di
ameter  PQ,  diminished  in the proportion  of 101  to 100,  is transformed  into
the  figure  of the earth  ; and  this  figure, by having  a  third  diameter  per
pendicular  to the two  diameters AB  and  PQ,  diminished  in the same  pro
portion,  is converted  into  the  said spheroid  ; and  the  force  of gravity  in A,
in either  case,  is diminished  nearly  in the same  proportion.  Therefore  the
force  of gravity  in A  towards  the sphere  described  about  the  centre  C with
the radius AC,  is to the force  of gravity  in A  towards  the  earth  as 126  to
1251.  And  the force  of gravity  in the  place Q  towards  the  sphere  de
scribed  about  the  centre  C  with  the radius QC,  is to the  force  of gravity
in the place A  towards  the sphere  described  about  the  centre  C, with  the
radius AC,  in the proportion  of the diameters  (by Prop. LXXII,  Book  I),
that  is, as 100  to 101.   If, therefore,  we compound  those  three proportions
126  to 125, 126  to 125|.  and  100  to 101,  into  one, the  force  of gravity  in
the place Q  towards  the earth  will  be  to the  force  of gravity  in  the  place
A  towards  the earth  as 126  X  126 X  100  to 125 X  125| X  101  ; or  as
:>01  to 500.
  Now  since  (by Cor.  3, Prop. XCI,  Book  I) the force  of gravity  in either
leg of the canal ACca,  or QCcy,  is as the  distance  of  the  places  from  the
centre  of the earth,  if those  legs  are conceived  to be divided  by  transverse.,
parallel, and  equidistant  surfaces,  into  parts  proportional  to the  wholes,
the weights  of any number  of parts  in the one  leg ACca   will  be  to  the
weights  of the same  number  of parts  in the other  leg as  their magnitudes
and  the  accelerative  forces  of  their  gravity  conjunctly,  that  is, as 10 J to
100, and  500  to 501.  or  as 505  to 501.  And  therefore  if the centrifugal
force  of every  part  in the leg ACca,  arising from  the diurnal  motion,  was
to the weight  of the same  part  as 4 to  505,  so  that  from  the  weight  of
every  part, conceived  to be  divided  into 505  parts, the  centrifugal  force
might  take  off four  of those  parts,  the weights  would  remain  equal  in each
leg, and  therefore  the  fluid would  rest in an equilibrium.  But  the  centri
fugal  force  of every  part  is to the weight  of  the same  part  as  1  to 289  ;
that  is, the centrifugal  force, which  should  be T£y  parts  of  the weight,  is
only ¥|g  part  thereof.  And,  therefore,  I say, by the rule  of proportion,
that  if the centrifugal  force  j ^  make  the height  of the  water  in the leg
ACca  to exceed  the height  of the water  in  the leg QCcq  by one  T|¥  part
of its whole  height,  the centrifugal  force  -^jj  will make  the  excess  of  the
height  in the leg ACca  only ^{^  part  of  the height  of the  water  in  the
other  leg QCcq  ; and  therefore  the diameter  of the earth  at the  equator,  is
to its diameter  from  pole  to pole  as 230  to 229.  And  since  the mean  semi-

| portion, is co | nver | ted into the | said | spheroid ; an | d the force of gr | avity in A, |
| in either case, | is | diminished n | early | in the same | proportion. Th | erefore the |

| the radius AC | , is | to the force | of gr | avity in A t | owards the eart | h as 126 to |

| 1251. And | the | force of grav | ity i | n the place | Q towards the | sphere de |

| in the place | A to | wards the sp | here | described ab | out the centre | C, with the |
| radius AC, in | the | proportion | of th | e diameters | (by Prop. LXXII | , Book I), |
| that is, as 10 | 0 to | 101. If, t | herefo | re, we compou | nd those three | proportions |
| 126 to 125, 1 | 26 | to 125|. and | 100 | to 101, into | one, the force of | gravity in |

| A towards th | e ea | rth as 126 | X 12 | 6 X 100 to | 125 X 125| X | 101 ; or as |
| :>01 to 500. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Now since | (by | Cor. 3, Prop | . XCI | , Book I) t h | e force of gravit | y in either |
| leg of the can | al A | Cca, or QCc | y, i | s as the dista | nce of the place | s from the |

| the weights o | f an | y number of | part | s in the one | leg ACca will | be to the |

| and the accel | erati | ve forces of | thei | r gravity con | junctly, that i | s, as 10 J to |
| 100, and 500 | to | 501. or as 50 | 5 to | 501. And t | herefore if the | centrifugal |
| force of every | par | t in the leg | ACca | , arising fro | m the diurnal | motion, was |
| to the weight | of | the same par | t as | 4 to 505, so | that from th | e weight of |
| every part, co | ncei | ved to be d | ivide | d into 505 | parts, the centri | fugal force |
| might take of | f fo | ur of those p | arts, | the weights | would remain eq | ual in each |

| that is, the c | entri | fugal force, | which | should be T | £y parts of the | weight, is |

 108                       THE   MATHEMATICAL    PRINCIPLES
                                                              [BooK  III.
diameter  of  the  earth, according  to PicarVs  mensuration,  is 19615800
Paris  feet, or 3923,16  miles  (reckoning  5000  feet  to  a  mile), the  earth
 will be higher  at the equator  than  at  the  poles by 85472   feet, or  17^-
miles.  And  its height  at the equator  will be about  19658600   feet, and  at
the poles 19573000   feet.
   If, the density  and  periodic  time  of the diurnal  revolution  remaining  the
same,  the planet  was  greater  or less than  the  earth, the  proportion  of  the
centrifugal  force  to that  of gravity,  and  therefore  also of  the diameter  be
twixt  the poles  to the diameter  at the  equator,  would  likewise  remain  the
game.  But  if the diurnal  motion  was  accelerated  or retarded  in any  pro
portion,  the centrifugal  force would  be augmented  or diminished  nearly  in
the same  duplicate  proportion  ; and  therefore  the  difference  of the diame
ters  will be increased  or diminished  in the same  duplicate  ratio  very  nearly.
And  if the density  of the planet  was  augmented  or diminished  in any  pro
portion,  the force  of gravity  tending  towards  it would  also  be augmented
or diminished  in the same  proportion  : and  the  difference  of  the diameters
contrariwise  would  be diminished  in proportion  as the  force  of gravity  is
augmented,  and augmented  in proportion  as the  force  of gravity  is dimin
ished.  Wherefore,  since  the  earth,  in respect  of the  fixed  stars,  revolves  in
23h.  56', but Jupiter  in  9h. 56', and  the squares  of  their  periodic  times  are
as 29  to 5, and  their  densities  as 400  to 94 £, the difference  of the diameters
                                                        29     400       1
of Jupiter  will be to its lesser diameter  as —  X ^^  X ^Tm  to 1; or  as 1 to
9 f, nearly.  Therefore  the diameter  of Jupiter  from  east  to west  is to its
diameter  from  pole  to  pole  nearly  as  10 £• to 9|-. Therefore  since  its
greatest  diameter  is 37",  its lesser diameter  lying between  the  poles  will
be 33" 25"'.  Add  thereto  about  3'' for  the irregular  refraction  of  light,
and  the apparent  diameters  of this planet  will  become  40'' and  36"  25"'  ;
which  are  to each  other  as  11 -j to 10^, very  nearly.  These  things  are  so
upon  the supposition  that  the  body  of Jupiter  is uniformly  dense.  But
now  if its body  be denser  towards  the plane  of the  equator  than  towards
the poles,  its diameters  may  be  to each  other  as 12  to 11, or  13  to  12,  or
perhaps  as 14  to  13.
  And  Cassini  observed  in the year  1691,  that  the  diameter  of Jupiter
reaching  from  east  to west  is greater by about  a fifteenth  part  than  the
other diameter.  Mr. Pound  with  his 123  feet  telescope, and  an  excellent
micrometer,  measured  the diameters  of Jupiter  in the year 1719,  and found
them  as follow.

   So  thut  the theory  agrees  with  the phenomena  ; for  the planets  are more
heated  by the  sun's  rays towards  their  equators,  and  therefore  are  a  lit fie
more  condensed  by that  heat  than  towards  their  poles.
   Moreover,  that  there  is a diminution  of gravity  occasioned  by the diur
nal rotation  of the  earth, and  therefore  the earth  rises higher  there  than  it
does  at the poles (supposing  that  its matter  is uniformly  dense), will  ap
pear by the experiments  of pendulums  related  under  the following  Propo
sition.

           PROPOSITION   XX.   PROBLEM   IV.

To find and  compare  together  the weights  of bodies  in  the  different  re
                         gions  of our  earth.
   Because  the weights  of the unequal  legs of the canal
of water ACQqca   are  equal  ; and  the weights  of  the
parts proportional  to the whole  legs, and  alike  situated
in  them,  are  one  to another  as  the  weights  of  the P|
wholes, and  therefore  equal  betwixt  themselves  ; the
weights  of equal  parts, and  alike  situated  in  the  legs,
will  be reciprocally  as the  legs, that  is, reciprocally  as
230  to 229.  And  the case  is the same  in all homogeneous  equal  bodies  alike
situated  in the legs of the canal.  Their  weights  are  reciprocally  as the legs,
that  is, reciprocally  as the distances  of the bodies  from  the centre  of the earth.
Therefore  if the bodies  are situated  in the uppermost  parts  of the canals,  or on
the surface  of the earth,  their weights  will  be one  to another  reciprocally  as
their  distances  from  the centre.  And.  by the same  argument,  the weights  in
all other  places round  the whole  surface  of the  earth  are reciprocally  as the
distances  of the places from  the  centre  ; and, therefore,  in  the  hypothesis

of the  earth's  being  a spheroid  are given  in proportion.
   Whence  arises  this Theorem,  that  the  increase  of weight  in passing from
 tne  equator  to the poles  is nearly  as the  versed  sine  of double  the latitude  ;
 or, which  comes  to the same  thinir, as the square  of the  right  sine  of  the
 latitude  ; and  the  arcs  of the degrees  of latitude  in  the meridian  increase
 nearly  in the same  proportion.  And,  therefore,  since  the  latitude  of Paris
 is 48°  50', that  of  places under  the equator  00°  00', and  that  of  places
 under  the  poles  90°  ; and  the  versed  sines  of  double  those  arcs  are
 11334,00000  and  20000,  the radius  being  10000  ; and  the force  of gravity
 at the pole  is to the  force  of gravity  at  the  equator  as 230  to 229  ; and
 the excess  of the  force  of gravity  at the  pole  to the  force  of gravity  at the
 equator  as 1 to 229  ; the  excess  of the  force  of gravity  in  the  latitude  of
 Paris  will be  to the  force  of gravity  at the equator  as 1 X Htll   to 229,
 or  as 5667  to 2290000.  And  therefore  the whole  forces  of gravity  in
 those  places  will  be one  to the other  as 2295667  to 2290000.  Wherefore
 since  the lengths  of pendulums  vibrating  in equal  times  are  as the forces  of

  By  this  table, therefore,  it appears  that  the  inequality  of degrees  is  sc
small,  that  the  figure of  the  earth, in geographical  matters,  may  be con
sidered  as spherical  ; especially  if the earth  be a little denser  towards  the
plane  of the equator  than  towards  the  poles.
  Now  several  astronomers,  sent  into remote  countries  to make  astronomical
observations,  have  found  that pendulum  clocks  do accordingly  move  slower
near  the equator  than  in our climates.  And,  first of  all, in the year  I 72,
M.  Richer  took  notice  of  it in the island  of Cayenne ; for when,  in the
month  of August,  he was  observing  the  transits  of the  fixed  stars  over  the
meridian,  he found  his clock  to go slower  than  it ought  in  respect  of  the
mean  motion  of the sun  at the  rate  of 2' 29"  a day.  Therefore,  fitting up
a simple pendulum  to vibrate  in seconds, which  were  measured  by an  ex
cellent  clock, he observed  the length  of that simple pendulum  ; and  this he
did  over  and  over  every  week  for  ten months  together.  And  upon  his  re
turn  to France,  comparing  the length  of  that  pendulum  with  the length

 of the pendulum  at Paris  (which  was  3 Paris  feet and 8f  lines), he found
 it shorter  by  1 j line.
   Afterwards,  our  friend  Dr.  Halley,  about  the year  1677, arriving  at  the
island  of St. Helena,  found  his pendulum  clock  to go slower  there  than  at
Isondon  without  marking  the  difference.  But  he  shortened  the  rod  of
his clock by more  than  the \ of an  inch, or l£  line  ; and  to effect  this, be
cause  the length  of the screw  at the lower  end  of the  rod was  riot sufficient,
he interposed  a wooden  ring betwixt  the nut  and  the  ball.
   Then,  in the year  1682, M.  Varin  and  M.  des Hayes  found  the length
of a simple pendulum  vibrating  in seconds  at  the Royal  Observatory  of
Paris  to be 3 feet and  S| lines.  And  by the same  method  in  the  island
of Goree,  they found  the length  of an isochronal  pendulum  to be 3 feet and
6 1 lines, differing from  the former  by two  lines.  And  in  the same  year,
going  to the  islands  of Guadeloupe  and  Martinico,  they found  that  the
length  of an  isochronal  pendulum  in those  islands  was  3  feet and  6^  lines.
   After  this, M.  Couplet,  the  son, in the month  of July  1697,  at the Royal
Observatory  of Paris,  so fitted  his pendulum  clock  to the mean  motion  of
the sun, that  for  a considerable  time  together  the  clock  agreed  with  the
motion  of the sun.  In November  following,  upon  his arrival  at Lisbon,  he

found  his clock  to go slower  than  before  at the  rate  of  2' 13"  in 24  hours.
And  next March  coming  to Paraiba,  he found  his clock  to go slower  than

at Paris,  and  at the  rate  4' 12"  in 24  hours  ; and  he  affirms, that  the pen
dulum  vibrating  in  seconds  was  shorter  at Lisbon  by 2±  lines, and  at Pa
raiba, by 3 1 lines, than  at Paris.  He  had  done  better  to have  reckoned
those  differences  \\ and 2f : for  these  differences  correspond  to the  differ

ences  of  the  times  2' 13"  and  4' 12".  But  this gentleman's  observations
are  so  gross,  that  we  cannot  confide  in them.
   In  the following  years, 1699,  and  1700,  M.  des Hayes,  making  another
voyage  to America,  determined  that  in the island  of Cayenne  and Granada
the length  of the pendulum  vibrating  in  seconds  was  a small  matter  less
than  3  feet and  6|  lines ; that  in  the  island  of  St. Christophers  it was
3  feet and  6f  lines ; and  in  the  island  of  St. Domingo  3  feet and  7
lines.

  And  in  the year  1704,  P. Feuille,  at Puerto  Bello  in America,  found
that the  length  of the pendulum  vibrating  in seconds  was  3 Paris  feet,
and  only  5--^ lines, that  is, almost  3 lines  shorter  than  at Paris  ; but  the
observation  was  faulty.  For  afterward,  going  to the island  of Martinico.
he found  the length  of the  isochronal  pendulum  there  3 Paris  feet and
 5 \ | lines.

  Now  the  latitude  of Paraiba   is 6° 38' south ; that  of Puerto  Bello  9°
 33' north  ; and  the latitudes  of the islands  Cayenne,  Goree, Gaudaloupe}
Martinico,  Granada,  St. Christophers,  and  St. Domingo,   are  respectively

412           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III

the excesses  of  the length  of the pendulum  at Paris  above  the lengths  of
the isochronal  pendulums  observed  in those  latitudes  are  a little  greater
than  by the  table  of  the lengths  of  the pendulum  before computed.  And
therefore  the earth  is a little higher  under  the  equator  than  by the prece
ding  calculus,  and  a little denser  at the  centre  than  in mines  near  the  sur
face, unless, perhaps,  the  heats  of the  torrid  zone  have  a little extended  the
length  of the pendulums.
   For  M.  Picart  has  observed,  that  a rod  of iron, which  in frosty weather
in the winter  season  was  one  foot  long, when  heated  by  lire, was  lengthened
into  one  foot  and   -]- line.  Afterward  M.  de  la Hire  found  that  a rod  of
iron, which  in the  like winter  season  was  6 feet long, when  exposed  to the
heat  of the summer   sun, was  extended  into  6 feet and  f line.  In  the former
case  the heat  was  greater  than  in the  latter ; but  in the  latter  it was  greater
than  the heat  of  the  external  parts of  a human  body ; for metals  exposed
to the summer  sun  acquire  a very  considerable  degree  of heat.  But  the rod
of  a pendulum  clock  is never  exposed  to the  heat  of  the summer  sun,  nor
ever  acquires  a heat  equal  to that  of  the external  parts  of  a human  body ;
and,  therefore, though  the  3 feet rod  of  a pendulum  clock  will indeed  be  a
little longer  in the summer  than  in the winter  season,  yet  the  difference  will
scarcely amount  to \ line.  Therefore  the  total  difference  of the lengths  of
isochronal  pendulums  in different  climates  cannot  be ascribed  to the  differ
ence  of heat ; nor  indeed  to the mistakes  of the French  astronomers.  For
although  there  is not  a perfect agreement  betwixt  their  observations,  yet
the  errors  are  so small  that  they may  be  neglected  ; and  in this  they  all
agree,  that  isochronal  pendulums  are  shorter  under  the  equator  than
at  the Royal  Observatory  of Paris,  by a  difference  not  less than  1{  line,
nor  greater  than  2| lines.  By  the observations  of M. Richer,  in the island
of Cayenne,  the  difference  was  1| line.  That  difference  being  corrected by
those  of M.  des Hayes,  becomes  \\ line  or l£ line.  By  the  less accurate
observations  of others,  the same  was  made  about  two lines.  And  this  dis
agreement  might  arise partly from  the  errors  of  the  observations,  partly
from  the dissimilitude  of the  internal  parts  of the  earth, and  the height  of
mountains  ; partly from  the  different  heats  of the  air.
   I take  an  iron  rod  of 3 feet long  to be shorter  by a sixth  part  of one  line
in winter  time  with  us here  in England  than  in the summer.  Because  of
the great heats  under  the equator,  subduct  this quantity  from  the  difference
of one  line and  a quarter  observed  by M. Richer,  and  there  will remain  one
line  TV, which  agrees  very  well with  lT-o£o ^ne  collected, by the theory  a
little before.  M.  Richer  repeated  his  observations,  made  in the  island  of
Cayenne,  every  week  for  ten months  together,  and compared  the lengths  of
the pendulum  which  he had  there  noted  in the iron  rods  with  the  lengths
thereof  which  he observed  in Prance.  This  diligence  and  care seems  to

have  been  wanting  to the other  observers.  If this gentleman's  observations

| For M. Pi | cart ha | s observed, | that a rod | of iron, which in fros | ty weather |
| in the winter | season | was one fo | ot long, whe | n heated by lire, was | lengthened |
| into one foo | t and - | ]- l ine. Aft | erward M. | de la Hire found th | at a rod of |
| iron, which i | n the li | ke winter | season was | 6 feet long, when expo | sed to the |
| heat of the s | ummer s | un, was ext | ended into 6 | feet and f l ine. In | the former |
| case the heat | was gre | ater than i | n the latter | ; b ut in the latter it w | as greater |
| than the heat | of the | external p | arts of a h | uman body ; f or metal | s exposed |
| to the summer | sun ac | quire a ver | y considerab | le degree of heat. B | ut the rod |
| of a pendulu | m clock | is never e | xposed to th | e heat of the summer | sun, nor |
| ever acquires | a heat | equal to th | at of the e | xternal parts of a hu | man body ; |
| and, therefore | , thoug | h the 3 fee | t rod of a p | endulum clock will i | ndeed be a |
| little longer | in the su | mmer than | in the wint | er season, yet the diff | erence will |
| scarcely amou | nt to \ | l ine. The | refore the | total difference of the | lengths of |
| isochronal pe | ndulums | in differe | nt climates | cannot be ascribed to | the differ |
| ence of heat ; | nor in | deed to the | mistakes of | the French astrono | mers. For |
| although ther | e is not | a perfect | agreement | betwixt their observ | ations, yet |
| the errors ar | e so sma | ll that t | hey may be | neglected ; and in th | is they all |
| agree, that | isochron | al pendul | ums are s | horter under the equ | ator than |
| at the Royal | Observ | atory of P | aris, by a | difference not less th | an 1{ line, |
| nor greater t | han 2| | lines. By | the observat | ions of M. Richer, in | the island |

| those of M. d | es Haye | s, becomes | \\ line or | l£ line. By the les | s accurate |

| from the diss | imilitud | e of the i | nternal parts | of the earth, and the | height of |

are  to be depended  on, the earth  is higher  under  the equator  than  at  the
poles, and  that by an  excess  of about  17 miles;  as appeared  above  by the
theory.

         PROPOSITION   XXI.   THEOREM   XVII.

 That  the equinoctial  points  go backward,  and  that  the axis  of the earth,
   by a nutation  in, every  annual   revolution,  twice  vibrates  towards  the
              ecliptic, and  as  often  returns  to  its former  position,.
   The   proposition  appears   from   Cor.  20,  Prop. LXVI,  Book   I ;  but
that  motion   of nutation  must  be  very  small,  and, indeed,  scarcely  per
ceptible.

        PROPOSITION   XXII.   THEOREM   XVIII.

 That  all the motions  of the ?noon,  and  all the inequalities  of those  motions,
           follow from  the principles  which  we  have  laid down.
  That  the  greater  planets, while  they  are  carried  about  the  sun, may  in
the mean  time  carry  other  lesser  planets, revolving  about  them  ; and  that
those  lesser planets must  move  in ellipses which  have  their  foci in the  cen
tres  of the greater,  appears  from  Prop. LXV,  Book  I.  But  then  their mo
tions  will  be several  ways  disturbed  by the action  of the sun,  and  they  will
suffer such  inequalities  as are  observed  in our moon.  Thus  our  moon  (by
Cor.  2, 3, 4, and  5, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) moves  faster, and, by a  radius
drawn  to the earth, describes  an  area  greater  for the  time, and  has  its orbit
less curved, and  therefore  approaches  nearer  to the  earth  in the  syzygies
than  in the quadratures,  excepting  in so far  as these  effects  are hindered  by
the motion  of eccentricity  ; for (by Cor.  9, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) the  eccen
tricity is greatest when  the  apogeon  of  the moon   is in the syzygies,  and
least when  the same  is in the quadratures  ; and  upon  this account  the  pe-
rigeon moon  is swifter, and  nearer  to us, but  the  apogeon  moon  slower,
arid farther  from  us, in the syzygies  than  in the quadratures.  Moreover,
the apogee  goes forward,  and  the nodes  backward   ; and  this  is done  not with
a regular  but  an  unequal  motion.  For  (by Cor.  7 and  8, Prop. LXVI,
Book  I) the apogee  goes  more  swiftly forward  in its syzygies, more  slowly
backward  in its quadratures;  and, by the  excess  of  its progress  above  its
regress, advances  yearly  in consequentia.  But, contrariwise,  the nodes  (by
Cor.  11, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) are quiescent  in their  syzygies,  and  go fastest
back  in their quadratures.  Farther,  the greatest  latitude  of the moon  (by
Cor.  10, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) is greater  in the quadratures  of  the moon
than  in  its syzygies.  And  (by Cor.  6, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) the mean  mo
tion  of the moon   is slower  in the perihelion  of the  earth  than  in its aphelion.
And  these  are the  principal  inequalities  (of the  moon)  taken  notice  of by
astronomers.

| drawn to the | earth, descri | bes an area gre | ater for the tim | e, and has | its orbit |

| less curved, | and therefor | e approaches n | earer to the ea | rth in the | syzygies |

| the motion | of eccentricity | ; f or (by Cor. | 9, P rop. LXVI, | Book I) | t he eccen |

   But  there  are yet other  inequalities  not  observed  by former  astronomers,
by which  the  motions  of the moon  are  so disturbed,  that  to  this day  we
have  not been  able  to bring them  under  any  certain  rule.  For  the veloc

syzygics,  and  the  least eccentricity  in the quadratures,  and  that inequality
which  we  call the variation,  are (by Cor.  14, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) in  the
course  of the year  augmented  and  diminished  in the  triplicate proportion
of  the sun's apparent  diameter.  And  besides  (by Cor.  1 and  2, Lem.  10,
and  Cor.  16, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) the  variation  is augmented  and
diminished  nearly  in the  duplicate  proportion  of  the time  between
the quadratures.  But  in  astronomical  calculations,  this  inequality
is commonly  thrown  into and confounded  with  the equation  of the  moon's
centre.

 To  derive  the unequal  motions  of the  satellites  of Jupiter and  Saturn
                   from  the motions  of our  moon.

  From  the motions  of our moon  we  deduce  the corresponding  motions  of
the moons  or  satellites  of Jupiter  in this manner,  by Cor.  16, Prop. LXVI,
Book  I.  The  mean  motion  of  the nodes  of  the outmost  satellite  of Jupiter
is to the mean  motion  of the nodes  of our moon  in  a proportion  compound
ed of the duplicate  proportion  of the periodic  times  of  the  earth  about  the
sun  to the periodic  times  of Jupiter  about  the  sun, and  the  simple  propor
tion  of the periodic  time  of the  satellite  about  Jupiter  to the periodic  time
of our moon  about  the  earth ; and,  therefore,  those  nodes,  in the  space  of

a hundred  years,  are  carried  8° 24' backward,  or  in  antecedentia.  The
mean  motions  of the nodes  of the inner  satellites  are  to the mean  motion  of

the nodes  of the outmost  as their  periodic  times  to the periodic  time  of the
former,  by the same  Corollary,  and  are  thence given.  And  the motion  of
the  apsis  of every  satellite  in consequential  is to the motion  of  its nodes  in
antecedentia  as the motion  of the apogee  of our moon  to the motion  of  its
nodes  (by the same  Corollary),  and  is thence  given.  But  the motions  of
the apsides  thus found  must  be diminished  in the proportion  of 5  to 9, or
of about  1 to 2, on  account  of  a cause  which  I cannot  here  descend  to  ex
plain.  The  greatest  equations  of the  nodes,  and  of the  apsis  of every  satel
lite, are  to the greatest  equations  of the nodes,  and  apogee  of our moon   re
spectively,  as the motions  of  the nodes  and  apsides  of the  satellites, in  the
time  of one revolution  of the former  equations,  to the motions  of the nodes
and  apogee  of our  moon,  in the time  of  one  revolution  of the  latter equa
tions.  The  variation  of a satellite  seen from  Jupiter  is to the variation  of
our  moon  in  tne  same  proportion  as the whole  motions  of  their  node?

respectively  during  the  times  in which  the  satellite and  our  moon  (after

         PROPOSITION   XXIV.   THEOREM   XIX.

 That  the flax and  reflux  of the sea  arise from  the  actions  oj  the sun
                                and  moon.

   By  Cor.  19 and  20, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I, it appears  that  the waters  of
the  sea ought  twice  to rise and  twice  to fall every  day.  as  well lunar  as solar ;
and  that  the greatest  height  of  the waters  in the open  and deep  seas ought
to follow  the appulse  of the luminaries  to the meridian  of  the  place by  a
less interval  than  6 hours  ; as happens  in all that  eastern  tract  of the Atlantic
and  jEthinpic  seas between  France  and  the Cape  of Good  Hope  ; and  on
the  coasts  of Chili  and  Pern,  in the Smith  Sea  ; in  all which  shores  the
ilo >d falls out  about  the  second,  third, or fourth  hour,  unless  where  the

motion' propagated  from  the deep  ocean  is by the shallowness  of  the  chaiir
nels, through  which  it passes  to some  particular  places, retarded  to  the
fifth, sixth,  or seventh  hour, and  even  later.  The  hours  I reckon  from  the
appulse  of each luminary  to the meridian  of  the  place, as  well  under   as
above  the horizon  ; and  by the  hours  of  the  lunar  day  I understand  the
24th  parts  uf that  time  which  the moon,  by its apparent  diurnal  motion,
employs  to come  about  again  to the meridian  of the place which  it left the
day before.  The  force  of the sun  or moon  in raising  the  sea  is greatest  in
 the appulse  of the luminary  to  the meridian  of the  place; but  the  force
impressed  upon  the  sea  at that  time  continues  a little while  after  the im
 pression,  and  is afterwards  increased  by  a new  though  less force  still  act
ing upon  it.  This  makes  the  sea  rise higher  and  higher,  till this new  force
becoming  too weak  to raise  it any  more,  the  sea  rises  to  its greatest  height.
And  this  will come  to pass, perhaps,  in  one  or  two  hours, but  more  fre
 quently  near  the shores  in about  three  hours,  or  even  more,  where  the  sea
 is shallow.

   The  two  luminaries  excite  two  motions,  wrhich  will  not appear  distinctly,
 but between  them  will  arise  one mixed  motion  compounded  out  of  both.
 In the conjunction  or opposition  of the luminaries  their  forces  will  be con
 joined, and  bring  on  the greatest  flood  and ebb.  In  the quadratures  the
 sun  will  raise  the waters  which  the moon  depresses,  and  depress  the waters
 which  the moon  raises, and  from  the  difference  of  their  forces  the smallest
 of all tides  will follow.  And  because  (as experience  tells  us) the  force  of
 the moon   is greater  than  that  of the sun,  the greatest  height  of the waters
 will happen  about  the  third  lunar hour.  Out  of the syzygies  and  quadra
 tures,  the greatest  tide, which  by  the single  force  of the moon  oujjht  to  fall
 out  at the  third  lunar  hour,  and  by the single  force  of the sun  at the  third
 solar  hour,  by the compounded  forces  of both  must  fall out  in an  interme-

diate  time  that aproaches  nearer  to the  third hour  of the moon  than   tc
that  of the sun.  And,  therefore,  while  the moon   is passing from  the syzy
gies to the quadratures,  during  which  time  the 3d hour  of the  sun  precedes
the 3d hour  of the moon,  the greatest  height  of the waters  will  also precede
the  3d hour  of the moon,  and  that, by the  greatest  interval, a  little  after
the octants  of the moon;  and, by like  intervals,  the greatest  tide  will  fol
low  the 3d  lunar  hour,  while  the moon  is passing  from  the quadratures  to
the syzygies.  Thus   it happens  in  the open  sea : for  in  the mouths  of
rivers  the ogreater  tides come  liter  to their  heiirht.O
   But  the  effects  of the luminaries  depend  upon  their  distances  from  the
earth  ; for when  they  are  less distant,  their  effects  are  greater, and  when
more  distant,  their  effects  are  less, and  that in  the  triplicate proportion  of
their apparent  diameter.  Therefore  it is that  the  sun,  in the winter  time,
being  then  in  its perigee,  has  a greater  effect, and makes  the  tides  in  the
syzygies  something  greater,  and  those  in  the quadratures  something   less
than  in the summer  season  ; and  every month  the moon,  while  in the  peri
gee,  raises  greater  tides than  at  the  distance  of  15 days  before  or  after,
when  it is in  its apogee.  Whence  it comes  to  pass  that  two  highest
tides do not  follow  one  the other  in two  immediately  succeeding  syzygies.
   The  effect  of either luminary  doth  likewise  depend  upon  its declination
or distance  from  the equator  ; for  if the luminary  was  placed  at the  pole,
it would  constantly  attract  all the parts  of  the waters  without  any  inten
sion  or remission  of its action, and  could  cause  no  reciprocation  of motion.
And,  therefore,  as the luminaries  decline  from  the equator  towards  either
pole, they  will, by degrees,  lose  their  force, and  on  this account  will  excite
lesser  tides  in the  solstitial  than  in the  equinoctial  syzygies.  But  in the
solstitial quadratures  they  will  raise greater  tides than  in the quadratures
about  the equinoxes ; because  the  force  of  the moon,  then  situated  in  the
equator,  most  exceeds  the force  of the sun.  Therefore  the  greatest  tides
fall out  in those  syzygies,  and  the  least  in  those  quadratures,  which  hap-
pen  about  the time  of both  equinoxes  : and  the  greatest  tide in the syzy
gies is always  succeeded  by  the least  tide  in  the quadratures,  as  we  find
by experience.  But, because  the sun  is  less distant  from  the  earth  in
winter  than  in summer,  it comes  to pass  that  the  greatest  and  least  tides
more  frequently  appear  before  than  after  the  vernal  equinox,  and  more
frequently  after than  before  the autumnal.
              K   1ST                    Moreover,  the  effects  of the  lumi
                                           naries depend  upon  the  latitudes  of
                                  places.  Let  AjoEP  represent  the

roid  will  nearly  represent  the  figure  of the  sea;  and  CF,  C/, CD,  Cd,
 will represent  the  heights  of  the  sea  in  the  places  F/, Dd.  But  far

NM  cutting  the  parallels F/, Dd,  in any  places RT,  and  the  equator AE
in S : CN  will represent  the  height  of  the sea  in  all those  places R, S,
T, situated  in this circle.  Wherefore,  in  the  diurnal  revolution  of  any
place F, the greatest  flood  will  be  in F,  at the  third  hour  after  the appulse
of the moon  to the meridian  above  the horizon  ; and  afterwards  the great
est ebb  in  Q,, at the  third  hour  after  the  setting of  the  moon  ; and  then
the greatest  flood in/,  at the  third  hour  after  the appulse  of the moon   to
the meridian  under  the horizon  ; and,  lastly, the greatest  ebb  in  Q,, at the
 third  hour  after  the rising  of the moon  ; and  the  latter  flood  in /  will  be
less than  the preceding  flood  in F.  For  the whole  sea  is divided  into  two
hemispherical  floods, one  in the hemisphere  KH/J  on  the  north  side, the
other  in the opposite  hemisphere  Khk,  which  we  may  therefore  call  the
northern  and  the southern  floods.  These  floods, being always  opposite  the one
 to the  other, come  by turns  to the meridians  of all places,  after  an interval
of 12 lunar hours.  And  seeing  the northern  countries  partake  more  of
 the northern  flood, and  the southern  countries  more  of the southern  flood,
thence  arise  tides, alternately  greater  and  less in  all places  without  the
equator,  in which  the luminaries  rise and  set.  But  the greatest  tide  will
happen  when  the moon  declines  towards  the vertex  of the  place, about  the
 third hour  after  the appulse  of the moon  to the meridian  above  the  hori
zon  ; and when  the moon  changes  its declination  to the  other  side  of  the
equator,  that which  was  the greater  tide  will  be changed  into  a  lesser.
And  the greatest  difference  of the  floods  will fall  out  about  the  times  of
 the  solstices  ; especially  if the ascending  node  of the moon  is about  the
Hrst  of Aries.  So  it is found  by experience  that  the morning  tides  in
winter  exceed  those  of the evening,  and  the  evening  tides  in summer   ex
ceed  those  of the morning  ; at Plymouth  by the height  of one  foot, but  at
Bristol  by the height  of 15  inches, according  to the observations  of  Cole-
press  and Sturmy.
  But  the  motions  which  we  have  been  describing  suffer  some  alteration
from  that  force  of reciprocation,  which  the  waters,  being  once  moved,  retain
a little while  by their  vis insita.  Whence   it comes  to pass  that  the  tides
may  continue  for some  time, though  the  actions  of  the luminaries  should

oease.  This  power  of retaining  the impressed  motion  lessens  the  difference
yf the alternate  tides, and  makes  those  tides which  immediately  succeed
after  the syzygies  greater, and  those which  follow  next  after  the quadra
tures  less. And  hence  it is that  the  alternate  tides  at Plymouth  and
Bristol  do not  differ much  more  one from  the  other  than  by the height  of
a foot  or 15  inches, and  that  the greatest  tides  of all at those  ports  are  not
the  first but  the third  after  the syzygies.  And,  besides,  all the motions  are
retarded  in  their passage  through  shallow  channels,  so  that  the  greatest
tides  of  all, in some  straits and  mouths  of rivers, are  the fourth  or  even  the
fifth after  the syzygies.
   Farther,  it may  happen  that  the  tide may  be propagated  from  the ocean
through  different  channels  towards  the same  port, and  may  pass  quicker
through  some  channels  than through  others ; in which  case  the same  tide,
divided  into  two  or more  succeeding  one  another, may  compound  new  mo
tions  of different kinds.  Let  us suppose  two  equal  tides flowing  towards
the same  port from  different  places, the  one  preceding  the  other  by 6 hours  ;
and  suppose  the  first tide  to happen  at the  third  hour  of the appulse  of the
moon  to the meridian  of the port.  If the moon   at the time  of the appulse
to the meridian  was  in the  equator,  every  6 hours  alternately  there would

arise equal  floods, which,  meeting  writh  as many  equal  ebbs, would  so bal
ance  one  the  other,  that  for  that  day, the water  would  stagnate  and  remain
quiet.  If the moon  then  declined  from  the  equator,  the  tides  in the ocean
would  be  alternately  greater  and  less, as was  said ; and from  thence  two

greater  and  two  lesser  tides  wrould  be  alternately  propagated  towards  that
port.  But  the two  greater  floods would  make  the greatest  height  of  the
waters  to fall out in  the  middle  time  betwixt  both  ; and  the  greater  and
lesser  floods would  make  the waters  to rise  to  a mean  height  in the middle
time  between  them, and  in the middle  time between  the two  lesser  floods  the
waters  would  rise  to their  least height.  Thus  in the space  of 24  hours  the
waters  would  come,  not  twice,  as commonly,  but once  only  to their  great
est, and  once  only to  their  least  height ; and  their  greatest  height,  if  the
moon  declined  towards  the elevated  pole, would  happen  at the 6th  or 30th
hour  after  the appulse  of the moon  to  the  meridian  ; and when  the moon
changed  its declination,  this  flood would  be changed  into  an ebb.  An  ex
ample  of all which  Dr.  Halley  has given  us, from  the observations  of  sea
men  in the port  of Bntshnm,  in the kingdom  of Tunqvin,  in the latitude

of 20°  50' north.  In that  port, on  the day which  follows  after  the passage
of the moon  over  the  equator,  the waters  stagnate:  when  the moon  declines
to the north,  they begin  to  flow and  ebb. not  twice,  as in other  ports, but
once  only  every day  : and  the  flood happens  at the  setting, and  the greatest
ebb  at  the rising  of the moon.  This  tide  increases  with  the declination  of
the moon   till the ?th  or 8th day ; then  for  the  7 or 8 days  following  it

| yf the alternate t | ides, and | makes | those tides | which | immediately | succeed |
| after the syzygies | greater, | and tho | se which f | ollow n | ext after the | quadra |
| tures less. And | hence it | is that | the altern | ate tid | es at Plymo | uth and |
| Bristol do not diff | er much | more on | e from the | other | than by the | height of |
| a foot or 15 inches | , and tha | t the gr | eatest tides | of all | at those port | s are not |
| the first but the th | ird after | the syz | ygies. And, | besides | , all the mo | tions are |
| retarded in their p | assage t | hrough | shallow cha | nnels, | so that the | greatest |
| tides of all, in some | straits | and mou | ths of river | s, are t | he fourth or | even the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| fifth after the syzy | gies. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Farther, it may | happen t | hat the | tide may b | e propa | gated from | the ocean |
| through different | channels | towards | the same | port, a | nd may pas | s quicker |
| through some chan | nels than | throu | gh others ; | i n whic | h case the | same tide, |
| divided into two o | r more su | cceedin | g one anoth | er, may | compound | new mo |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tions of different | kinds. L | et us s | uppose two | equal | tides flowin | g towards |
| the same port from | different | places, | the one pre | ceding | the other by | 6 hours |
| and suppose the fi | rst tide to | happen | at the thir | d hour | of the appul | se of the |
| moon to the merid | ian of th | e port. | If the moo | n at th | e time of th | e appulse |
| to the meridian wa | s in the | equator, | every 6 h | ours al | ternately th | ere would |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| ance one the other, | that for | that da | y, the water | would | stagnate an | d remain |

| would be alternat | ely great | er and | less, as was | said ; | and from t | hence two |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| greater and two le | sser tides | wrould | be alternat | ely pro | pagated tow | ards that |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

 decreases  at the same  rate  as  it had  increased  before, and  ceases when  the
moon  changes  its declination,  crossing  over  the equator  to the south.  Af
 ter which  the flood  is immediately  changed  into  an  ebb;  and  thenceforth
 the ebb happens  at the setting  and  the  flood  at the rising  of the moon  : till
the moon,  again  passing  the  equator,  changes  its declination.  There  are
two  inlets  to this port and  the  neighboring  channels,  one from  the  seas  of
 China,  between  the continent  and  the  island  of Lenconia  ; the other  from
the Indian  sea, between  the  continent  and  the  island  of Borneo.  But
whether  there  be really two  tides propagated  through  the  said  channels,  one
from  the Indian  sea  in  the  space  of 12  hours, and  one  from  the  sea  of
 Cliina  in the space  of 6 hours, which  therefore  happening  at the 3d  and
9th  lunar  hours, by being compounded  together,  produce  those  motions  : or
whether  there  be any  other  circumstances  in the  state  of those  seas.  I leave
to be determined  by observations  on  the neighbouring  shores.
   Thus  I have  explained  the causes  of the motions  of the moon  and  of the
sea.  Now   it is fit to subjoin something  concerning  the  quantity  of  those
motions.

          PROPOSITION   XXV.   PROBLEM    VI.

 To  find  the forces  with  which  the sun  disturbs  the 'motions  of the moon.
   Let  S represent  the  sun, T  the
earth, P  the moon, CADB   the
moon's  orbit.  In SP  take SK
equal  to ST;  and  let SL  be  to
SK  in  the  duplicate  proportion
of SK  to SP:  draw LM   parallel
to PT  ; and  if ST  or SK   is sup-
posed  to represent  the accelerated  force  of gravity  of the earth  towards  the
sun, SL  will  represent  the  accelerative  force  of gravity  of the moon  towards
the sun.  But  that  force  is compounded  of the  parts SM  and LM,  of which
the  force LM,  and  that  part of SM  which  is represented  by TM,  disturb
the motion  of the  moon,  as we  have  shewn  in Prop. LXVI,  Book  I, and
its Corollaries.  Forasmuch  as  the earth  and  moon  are  revolved  about
their common   centre  of gravity,  the motion  of the earth  about  that  centre
will  be also  disturbed  by the  like forces;  but we  may  consider  the  sums
both  of the forces  and  of the motions  as in the moon,  and  represent  the sum
of the  forces by the  lines TM  and ML,  which  are  analogous  to them  both.
The  force ML   (in its mean  quantity)  is to  the  centripetal  force by which
the moon  may  be retained  in  its orbit revolving  about  the earth  at  rest,  at

the distance  P'J  , in  the  duplicate  proportion  of  the periodic  time  of  the
moon  about  the earth  to the  periodic  time  of  the  earth  about  the sun  (by
Cor.  17, Prop. LXVI,  Book  I) ; that  is, in the duplicate  proportion  of 27d.

| decreases | at the | same rate as | it had incr | eased before, | and ceases | when the |

| ter which | the flo | od is immedi | ately chan | ged into an | ebb; and | thenceforth |
| the ebb ha | ppens | at the setting | and the fl | ood at the ris | ing of the | moon : t ill |
| the moon, | again | passing the | equator, ch | anges its decl | ination. | There are |
| two inlets | to this | port and th | e neighbori | ng channels, | one from | the seas of |
| China, be | tween | the continent | and the is | land of Lencon | ia ; the | other from |
| the India | n sea, | between the | continent | and the isla | nd of Bo | rneo. But |
| whether t | here be | really two ti | des propagat | ed through t | he said ch | annels, one |
| from the | Indian | sea in the | space of 1 | 2 hours, and | one from | the sea of |
| Cliina in | the spa | ce of 6 hour | s, which t | herefore happ | ening at | the 3d and |
| 9th lunar | hours, | by being co | mpounded to | gether, produ | ce those | motions : or |
| whether t | here be | any other c | ircumstances | in the state | of those s | eas. I leave |
| to be dete | rmined | by observati | ons on the | neighbouring | shores. |  |
| Thus I | have e | xplained the | causes of th | e motions of | the moon | and of the |
| sea. Now | it is f | it to subjoin | something | concerning th | e quantit | y of those |
| motions. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| the motion | of th | e moon, as w | e have sh | ewn in Prop. | LXVI, B | ook I, a nd |

4ih  Prop,  of this Book  we found,  that,  if both  earth  and  moon  were  revolved
aoout  their common   centre  of gravity,  the mean  distance  of  the one from
the other  would  be nearly 60^ mean  semi-diameters  of  the  earth  : and  the
force by which  the moon  may  be kept revolving  in  its orbit about  the earth
in rest  at  the  distance PT  of 60^ semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  is to the
force by which  it may  be revolved  in the same  time,  at the  distance  of 60
semi-diameters,  as 60|  to 60  : and  this  force  is to the  force  of gravity  with
u,;3 very  nearly  as I to 60 X 60.  Therefore  the mean  force ML   is to the
force  of gravity  on  the  surface  of our  earth  as 1 X  60-} to 60 X  60 X  60

To  find  the horary  increment  of the  area  which  the moon,  by a  radius

                                                       by the  action  of  the

                                                   propose  to  investi
 gate  the   HI equality  of the  moment,  or horary  increment  of  that  area  or
 motion  so disturbed.  To  render  the calculus  more  easy, we  shall suppose
 the  orbit  of the moon  to be  circular, and  neglect  all inequalities  but  that
 only which  is now  under  consideration  ; and, because  of  the immense  dis
 tance  of the  sun, we  shall  farther  suppose  that  the  lines SP  and ST   are
 parallel.  By  this moans,  the  force LM   will  be always  reduced  to its mean
 quantity  TP,  as well  as  the  force TM   to its mean  quantity 3PK.  These
 forces  (by Cor. 2  of the Laws  of Motion)  compose  the  force TL  ; and
 this  force, by letting  fall the  perpendicular LE  upon  the  radius TP,  is
 resolved  into  the  forces TE, EL  ; of which  the  force TE,  acting  constantly
 in the direction  of  the  radius TP,  neither  accelerates  nor  retards  the  de
 scription  of  the  area TPC  made  by that  radius TP  ; but EL,  acting  on
 the radius TP  in  a perpendicular  direction,  accelerates  or retards  the de
 scription  of the area  in proportion  as  it accelerates   ->r retards  the  moon.

That  acceleration  of the moon,  in  its passage  from  the quadrature  C  to the
conjunction  A,  is in every moment  of  time  as the generating  accclerative
                 3PK  X TK
force EL,  that  is, as      —.5           .  Let  the time  be  represented  by  the

mean  motion  of the moon,  or (which  comes  to the same  thing)  by the angle
CTP,  or even  by the  arc CP.  At  right  angles  upon CT  erect CG  equal
to CT  ; and, supposing  the quadrantal  arc AC   to be divided  into  an  infinite
number  of equal  parts  P/?, &c.,  these parts  may  represent  the  like  infinite
number  of the equal  parts  of time.  Let  fall pic perpendicular  on CT,  and
draw TG  meeting  with  KP, kp  produced  in F  arid /;  then  will FK   be
equal  to TK,  and  K/v  be  to PK  as P/> to T/?, that  is, in  a given  propor-
                                                 3PK  X TK

tion ; and  therefore FK  X  K&,  or  the area FKkf,  will be as  -  ~^pp          '>
that  is, as EL:  and  compounding,  the whole  area GCKF   will be  as  the
sum  of all the  forces EL  impressed  upon  the moon  in the whole  time CP  ;
and  therefore  also  as the velocity generated  by that sum,  that  is, as the  ac
celeration  of the  description  of the  area CTP,   or  as the increment  of the
moment  thereof.  The  force by which  the moon  may  in  its periodic  time

CADB   of  27'1. 7h. 43'  be retained  revolving  about  the  earth  in rest  at the
distance  TP,  would  cause  a body  falling  in  the  time CT  to  describe  the
length ^CT,  and  at the same  time  to acquire  a velocity equal  to that  with
which  the moon  is moved  in  its orbit.  This  appears  from  Cor.  9, Prop,
IV., Book  I.  But  since  K.d, drawn  perpendicular  on TP,  is but  a  third
part  of EL,  and  equal  to the half  of TP,  or ML,  in the  octants,  the  force
EL  in the  octants, where  it is greatest,  will  exceed  the  force ML   in the
proportion  of 3  to 2 ; and  therefore  will  be  to that  force  by which  the moon
in  its periodic  time may  be retained  revolving  about  the earth  at rest  as
100  to | X  178721,  or 11915;  and  in the  time CT  will  generate  a  ve
locity equal  to yylfs  parts of  the velocity  of  the moon  ; but  in the time
CPA  will  generate  a greater  velocity  in the  proportion  of CA  to CT   or
TP.   Let  the greatest  force EL  in the  octants  be represented  by the  area
FK  X  Kk,  or  by the  rectangle |TP  X  Pp, which  is equal  thereto;  and
the velocity which  that  greatest  force  can  generate  in any  time CP  will be
to the velocity which  any  other  lesser  force EL  can  generate  in the  same
time  as the rectangle |TP  X CP  to  the  area KCGF   ; but  the  velocities
generated  in the whole  time CPA   will  be one  to the other  as the rectangle
2-TP X CA  to the  triangle TCG,  or  as  the  quadrantal  arc CA  to  the
radius TP  ; and  therefore  the  latter  velocity generated  in the whole  time
will be TT$TJ  parts  of the velocity  of  the moon.  To  this velocity  of  the
moon,  which  is proportional  to the mean  moment  of  the  area  (supposing
this mean  moment  to be  represented  by the number  11915),  we  add  and
subtract  the half  of  the  other  velocity ; the sum  11915  +  50, or 11965,
will represent  the  greatest moment   of the  area  in the syzygy  A  : and  the

 tures.  Therefore  the  areas  which  in equal times  are described  in the syzy-
 gies and quadratures  are  one  to^the other  as 11965  to 11865.  And  if to
 the least moment  11865  we  add  a moment  which  shall  be to 100,  the  dif
 ference  of the two  former  moments,  as the trapezium FKCG   to the triangle

 the square  of the radius TP  (that  is, as Pd  to TP),  the sum  will represent
 the moment   of the  area  when  the moon   is in any  intermediate  place  P.
   But  these  things  take  place only  in the hypothesis  that  the sun  and  the
 earth  are  at  rest, and  that  the synodical  revolution  of  the moon  is finished

 in  27'1. 7h. 43 .  But  since  the  moon's  synodical  period  is really  29a.  12h.
 4 T, the increments  of  the moments  must  be enlarged  in the same  propor
 tion  as  the  time  is, that  is, in  the  proportion  of 1080853  to 1000000.
 Upon  whicli  account,  the whole  increment,  which  was  TTITTT  parts of  the
mean  moment,  will  now  become  TY£|  3- parts  thereof;  and  therefore  the
moment  of  the area  in the quadrature  of  the moon  will  be  to the moment
thereof  in  the  syzygy  as 11023 —  50  to 11023  +  50;  or  as  10973   to
 11073;  and  to the moment  thereof, when  the moon  is in any intermediate
place P, as 10973  to 10973  -f Pd  ; that  is, supposing TP  =   100.
   The  area,  therefore, which  the  moon,  by a  radius  drawn  to the  earth,
describes m  the several  little  equal  parts of  time,  is nearly  as the  sum  of
the number  219,46,  and  the  versed  sine  of the double  distance  of the moon
from  the  nearest  quadrature,  considered  in  a circle which  hath  unity  for  its
radius.  Thus   it is when  the variation  in the octants  is in its mean  quantity.
 3ut  if the variation  there  is greater  or less, that versed  sine must  be aug-
nented  or diminished  in  the same  proportion.

From  the horary  motion  of the moon   to find  its distance from  the  earth.
  The  area which  the  moon,  by  a radius  drawn  to the  earth, describes  in
every, moment   of time,  is as the horary  motion  of the moon  and  the square
of the distance  of the moon  from  the  earth conjunctly.  And  therefore  the
distance  of the moon  from  the earth  is in  a proportion  compounded  of  the
subduplicate  proportion  of  the  area  directly, and  the subduplioate  propor
tion  of the horary  motion  inversely.  Q.E.T.
   COR.  1 . Hence  the apparent  diameter  of the moon  is given ; for  it is re
ciprocally  as  the  distance  of  the moon  from  the earth.  Let  astronomers
try how  accurately  this  rule  agrees  with  the phenomena.

from  the phaenomena  than  hitherto  could  be done.

        PROPOSITION   XXVIII.   PROBLEM   IX.

To find  the diameters  of  the  orbit, in which,  without  ec*.t'itricity,  the
                           moon  would  move.

   The  curvature  of the  orbit which  a body  describes,  if attracted  in lines
perpendicular  to the  orbit,  is as the  force  of  attraction  directly, and  the
square  of  the velocity inversely.  I estimate  the  curvatures  of  lines com
pared  one  with  another  according  to the evanescent  proportion  of the  sines
or tangents  of their  angles  of contact  to equal  radii, supposing  those  radii
to be infinitely diminished.  Blit  the  attraction  of  the moon  towards  the
earth  in the  syzygies  is the  excess  of  its gravity  towards  the  earth  above
the  force  of the sun 2PK   (see Pig. Prop. XXV);  by which  force  the  accel-
erative  gravity  of the moon  towards  the  sun  exceeds  the accelerative  gravity
of the earth  towards  the  sun,  or is exceeded  by it.  But  in the quadratures
that  attraction  is the sum  of  the gravity  of  the moon  towards  the  earth,

and  the  sun's  force KT,  by which  the moon  is attracted  towards  the  earth.
                              AT  + CT         178725
And  these  attractions,  putting  N  for -   ^ -      •> are  nearly  as  — T™^ --

          and -     + -          or  as 178725N  X CT*  -  2000AT*

X  CT,  and 17S725N  X AT2  +  1000CT2  X AT.   For  if the accelera
tive gravity  of the moon  towards  the earth  be  represented  by the number
178725,  the mean  force ML,  which  in the  quadratures  is PT  or TK,  and
draws  the moon  towards  the  earth,  will be 1000, and  the mean  force TM   in
the syzygies  will  be 3000  ; from  which,  if we  subtract  the mean  force ML,
there  will  remain  2000,  the  force  by which  the moon  in  the  syzygies  is
drawn  from  the  earth, and  which  we  above  called  2 PIC.  But  the velocity
of the moon  in  the  syzygies  A and B  is to its velocity in  the  quadratures
C  and D  as CT   to AT,  and  the moment  of  the  area, which  the moon  by
a radius  drawn  to the earth  describes  in the  syzygies,  to the moment   of that
area  described  in  the  quadratures  conjunctly  ; that  is, as 11073CT   to
10973 AT.  Take  this  ratio  twice  inversely,  and  the former  ratio  once  di
rectly, and  the curvature  of the  orb of  the moon  in the syzygies  will  be  to
the curvature  thereof  in the quadratures  as 120406729  X 17S725AT2  X
CT2  X N—  120406729  X 2000AT4  X CT   to 122611329  X  178725 AT2
X CT2  X N  +  122611329  X 1000CT4  X  AT,  that  is, as 2151969AT
X CT  X  N —  24081AT3   to 2191371AT  X CT  X  N +  12261CT3.
   Because  the figure of the  moon's  orbit  is unknown,  let us, in its stead,
assume  the  ellipsis DBCA,   in the  centre  of which  we  suppose  the earth  to
be situated,  and  the greater  axis DC   to lie between  the quadratures  as the
lesser AB  between  the syzygies.  But  since  the plane  of this  ellipsis  is re-
rolved  about  the earth by an  angular  motion,  and  the  orbit, whose  curva
ture  we  now  examine,  should  be  described  in  a plane  void  of such  motion

                               we  are  to consider  the  figure which  the  moon,
                               while  it is revolved  in that  ellipsis, describes  iu
                              this  plane, that  is to  say, the  figure Cpa,  the
                                 several  points  p of which  are found  by assuming
                               any  point P in the  ellipsis, which  may  represent
                                the place of  the  moon,  and  drawing  Tp  equal
                                  to TP  in such manner  that  the  angle PT/? may
                                be equal  to the apparent  motion  of the sun from
                                 the time  of the last quadrature  in C  ; or (which
                             comes  to the  same  thing)  that  the  angle CTp
                         may  be  to  the  angle CTP   as the  time  of  the
                             synodic  revolution  of the moon  to the time  ot
the periodic  revolution  thereof,  or  as  29'1. 12h. 44' to 27d.  7'1. 43'.   If, there
fore, in this  proportion  we  take  the angle CTa   to the  right  angle CTA,
and make  Ta  of equal  length  with TA,  we  shall have  a the lower  and C
the upper  apsis of  this  orbit Cpa.  But, by computation,  I find  that  the
difference  betwixt  the curvature  of this  orbit Cpa  at the  vertex  a, and  the
curvature  of a circle described  about  the  centre T  with  the interval TA,  is
to the  difference  between  the curvature  of the  ellipsis  at the vertex  A, and
the curvature  of  the same  circle, in the  duplicate  proportion  of  the angle
CTP   to the angle CTp  ; and  that  the curvature  of  the  ellipsis  in A  is to
the curvature  of that  circle  in the duplicate  proportion  of TA  to TC  ; and
the curvature  of that  circle  to the curvature  of  a circle described  about  the
centre T  with  the  interval TC   as TC   to TA  ; but  that  the curvature  of
this  last arch  is to the curvature  of the  ellipsis in C  in the duplicate  pro
portion  of TA  to TC   ; and  that  the difference  betwixt  the curvature  of the

ellipsis  in the vertex  C* and  the  curvature  of  this  List  circle,  is to the  difference  betwixt  the curvature  of the  figure Cpa,  at the vertex  C, and  the
curvature  of this same  last  circle, in the duplicate  proportion  of  the angle
CTp  to the angle CTP   ; all which  proportions  are  easily drawn  from  the
sines  of the angles  of contact,  and  of  the differences  of  those angles.  But,
by comparing  those  proportions  together,  we  find the curvature  of the figure
Cpa  at a  to be to its curvature  at C  as AT3,-  rWoVoCT2AT   to CT3   -r

their  half  difference,  then CT  will  be =  1 +  x, and AT  =   1 —  x.  And
substituting  those  values  in the  equation,  after  resolving  thereof,  wre  shall
find  x =  0,00719  ; and  from  thence  the semi-diameter  CT =   1,00719,  and
the semi-diameter  AT  =  0,99281,  which  numbers  are  nearly  as 70^,  and
692V-  Therefore  the moon's  distance  from  the earth  in the syzygies  is to
its distance  in the quadratures  (setting  aside  the consideration  of eccentrici
ty) as 09 2^  to 70^  ; or, in round  numbers,  as 69  to 70.

          PROPOSITION   XXIX.   PROBLEM   X.

                     To  find  the variation  of the moon.

   This  inequality  is owing  partly  to the  elliptic figure  of the moon's  orbit,
partly  to the inequality  of  the moments  of  the  area  which  the moon  by  a
radius  drawn   t\) the  earth describes.  If the moon  P revolved  in the  ellipsis
DBCA   about  the  earth  quiescent  in the  centre  of the  ellipsis, and  by the
radius  TP, drawn  to the  earth, described  the  area CTP,  proportional  to
the time  of description  ; and  the greatest  semi-diameter  CT   of the  ellipsis
was  to the  least TA   as 70  to 69;  the tangent  of the angle CTP  would  be
to the tangent  of the angle  of  the mean  motion,  computed  from  the quad
rature  C, as  the semi-diameter  TA   of the  ellipsis  to its semi-diameter  TC,
or  as 69  to 70.  But  the description  of the  area CTP,  as the moon  advan
ces from  the quadrature  to  the  syzygy,  ought  to be  in such manner  accel

erated,  that  the moment  of  the area  in  the  moon's  syzygy  may  be  to the
moment  thereof  in  its quadrature  as 11073  to 10973;  and  that  the  excess
of the moment  in any intermediate  place P above  the moment  in the quad
rature may  be  as the square  of the  sine  of the angle CTP   ; which  we may
effect with  accuracy  enough,  if we  diminish  the tangent  of the angle CTP
in the subduplicate  proportion  of the number  10973  to the number  11073,
that  is, in  proportion  of  the number  68,6877  to the number  69.  Upon
which  account  the tangent  of the  angle CTP   will now  be  to the tangent
of the mean  motion  as 68,6877  to 70 ; and  the angle CTP   in  the  octants,
where  the mean  motion  is 45°, will  be found  44°  27'  28", which  sub
tracted  from  45°, the angle  of the mean  motion,  leaves  the  greatest  varia
tion  32' 32".  Thus   it would  be, if the moon,  in passing  from  the quad
rature  to the syzygy,  described  an  angle CTA   of 90  degrees only.  But
because  of  the motion  of the  earth, by which  the  sun  is apparently  trans
ferred  in consequentia^  the moon,  before  it overtakes  the  sun, describes  an
angle  CTtf,  greater  than  a right  angle,  in the proportion  of the time  of the
synodic  revolution  of the moon  to the time  of  its periodic  revolution,  thai

of  the duplicate  proportion  of  the time  of the  synodic  revolution  of  the

nodes ; Q, g the quadratures  of the moon  in  the plane  of the  ecliptic, and
pK  a perpendicular  on  the  line Qq  lying  between  the quadratures.  The
force  of  the  sun  to disturb  the  motion  of the moon  (by Prop. XXV)   is
twofold,  one  proportional  to the  line LM,  the  otlier  to the  line MT,  in the
scheme  of  that  Proposition  ; and  the moon  by the  former  force  is drawn
towards  the  earth, by the  latter towards  the  sun,  in a direction  parallel  to
the right  line ST  joining  the  earth  and  the sun.  The  former  force LM

acts  in the direction  of  the plane  of the moon's  orbit, and  therefore  makes
no change  upon  the situation  thereof, and  is upon  that  account  to be neg

lected  ; the  latter  force MT,  by which  the plane  of the moon's  orbit  is dis
turbed,  is the same  with  the  force 3PK   or SIT.  And  this  force  (by Prop.
XXV)   is to the  force by which  the moon  may,  in  its periodic  time, be uni
formly  revolved  in  a circle about  the earth  at  rest, as SIT  to the radius  of
the  circle multiplied  by the number  178,725,  or  as IT  to the radius  there
of multiplied  by 59,575.  But  in  this calculus,  and  all that  follows.  I
consider  all the lines  drawn  frorri the moon  to  the sun  as  parallel  to  the
line which  joins  the earth  and  the  sun ; because  what  inclination  there  is
almost  as much  diminishes  all effects  in some  cases  as it augments  them
in others  : and  we  are now  inquiring  after  the mean  motions  of the nodes,
neglecting  such  niceties  as  are  of no moment,  and  would  only  serve  to ren
der  the calculus  more  perplexed.
  Now  suppose PM   to represent  an  arc which  the moon  describes  in the
least moment  of  time, and ML   a little  line, the half  of which  the moon,
by the impulse  of the  said  force  SIT, would  describe  in the same  time  ; and
joining  PL, MP,  let them  be produced  to m  and  /, where  they cut  the plane
of  the  ecliptic, and upon Tm   let fall  the perpendicular PH.  Now,  since
the right  line ML   is parallel  to the plane  of the  ecliptic, and  therefore  can
never  meet  with  the  right  line ml  which  lies  in that  plane, and  yet both
those  right  lines  lie in  one common  plane LMPm/,  they  will be  parallel,
and  upon  that  account  the  triangles LMP,  ImP  will  be similar.  And
seeing MPra   lies  in the plane  of the  orbit, in which  the moon  did move
while  in the place P, the point m  will  fall upon  the  line  N//, which  passes
through  the nodes  N,  n, of that orbit.  And  because  the force by which  the
half  of the  little line LM   is generated,  if the whole  had  been  together,  and
 it once impressed  in the point  P, would  hav^  generated  that  whole  line,
and  caused  the moon  to move  in the  arc whoso  chord  is LP  ; t  at is to say,
would  have  transferred  the moon  from  the  plane MPwT   into  the plane
LP/T;  therefore  th* angular  motion  of  the nodes  generated  by that  force
will  be equal  to the  angle mTL   But  n.l  is to raP  as ML   to MP  ; and
since  ML3, because  of the time  given,  is also given, ml  will be as the  rectan-

| twofold, one prop | ortional to the | line LM, t | he otlier to the | line | MT, in the |
| scheme of that P | roposition ; and | the moon | by the former | for | ce is drawn |
| towards the earth | , by the latter | towards th | e sun, in a direc | tion | parallel to |
| the right line ST | joining the e | arth and t | he sun. The f | ormer | force LM |

| formly revolved | in a circle about | the earth | at rest, as SIT | to th | e radius of |
| the circle multipl | ied by the numb | er 178,725 | , or as IT to t | he ra | dius there |
| of multiplied by | 59,575. But | in this ca | lculus, and all | tha | t follows. I |
| consider all the | lines drawn fror | ri the moon | to the sun as | para | llel to the |
| line which joins | the earth and t | he sun ; b e | cause what incl | inat | ion there is |
| almost as much | diminishes all | effects in s | ome cases as it | augm | ents them |

| neglecting such | niceties as are of | no moment | , and would on | ly s | erve to ren |

| Now suppose | PM to represent | an arc wh | ich the moon | descr | ibes in the |

| by the impulse o | f the said force | SIT, would | describe in the | same | time ; a nd |
| joining PL, MP, | let them be prod | uced to m | and /, w here th | ey cu | t the plane |

| the right line ML | is parallel to | the plane o | f the ecliptic, an | d th | erefore can |
| never meet with | the right line | ml which | lies in that plan | e, a | nd yet both |
| those right lines | lie in one comm | on plane | LMPm/, they | will | be parallel, |
| and upon that | account the tri | angles LMP | , ImP will be | sim | ilar. And |
| seeing MPra lies | in the plane o | f the orbit | , in which the | moon | did move |
| while in the plac | e P, the point m | will fall | upon the line N | //, w | hich passes |
| through the node | s N, n, of that o | rbit. And | because the for | ce b | y which the |

gle ML  X mP,  that  is, as the rectangle IT  X  mP.   And  if Tml   is a right

ano-le, the  angle mTl   will  be  as 7^—'Tmand  therefore  as — Tm^—    —  that  is (be-

cause Tm  and mP, TP  and PH   are  proportional),  as —ITxPH*FFp~  ' and, there
fore, because TP   is given,  as IT  X PH.  But  if the  angle Tml  or STN
is oblique,  the angle mTl   will  be yet  less, in proportion  of  the  sine of  the
angle STN   to  the  radius,  or AZ   to AT.  And  therefore  the  velocity  of
the nodes  is as IT  X PH  X AZ,  or  as  the  solid content  of the  sines  of the
three  angles TPI, PTN,  and STN.
   If these  are  right  angles,  as happens  when  the nodes  are  in the quadra
tures, and  the moon  in  the  syzygy,  the  little  line ml  will  be removed  to
an  infinite  distance,  and  the  angle mTl  will become  equal  to the angle
mPl.  But  in this case  the  angle mPl   is to  the  angle PTM,  which  the
moon  in the same  time  by its apparent  motion  describes  about  the  earth,
as  1 to 59,575.  For  the angle mPl   is equal  to the angle LPM,  that  is, to

the angle  of the  moon's  deflexion  from  a rectilinear  path;  which  angle,  if
the gravity  of  the moon  should  have  then  ceased,  the  said  force  of the sun
SIT  would  by  itself have  generated  in  that  given  time  : and  the angle

PTM   is equal  to the angle  of the moon's  deflexion  from  a rectilinear  path;
which  angle,  if the  force  of the sun 31T  should  have  then  ceased,  the force
alone  by which  the moon  is retained  in  its orbit would  have  generated  in
the same  time.  And.  these  forces  (as we have  above  shewn)  are  the one  to
the  other  as  I to 59,575.  Since,  therefore,  the mean  horary  motion  of the

moon  (in respect  of the  fixed  stars)  is 32' 56"  27'"  12^-iv. the horary  motion
of the node  in this  case  will  be 33"  10"'  331V. 12V.  But  in other  cases  the
horary  motion  will  be to 33"  10'"  33iv. \2\  as the  solid  content  of the sines
of the  three  angles TPI, PTN,  and STN   (or of  the distances  of the moon

sun)  to the cube  of  the radius.  And   as often  as the  sine of any  angle  is
changed  from  positive  to negative,  and  from  negative  to positive,  so  often
must  the regressive  be changed  into  a progressive,  and  the progressive  into
a regressive motion.  Whence   it comes  to pass  that  the  nodes  are  pro
gressive  as often  as the moon  happens  to be placed  between  either quadra
ture, and  the  node  nearest  to  that quadrature.  In  other  cases  they  are
regressive, and  by the  excess  of  the  regress  above  the  progress,  they  are
monthly  transferred  in antecedentia.

| If these are | right angles, | as happens | when the | nodes are in | the | quadra |

 nodes  joined  by the line  N//, ; pK  and  ink perpendiculars  upon  the  axis  Q,</,
 produced  both  ways  till they meet  the  circle  in P and  M,  and  the  line  of
 the nodes  in D  and  cl. And  if the  moon,  by  a radius  drawn  to the  earth,
 describes  an  area  proportional  to the  time  of description,  the horary motion
 of the node  in the  ellipsis  will  be  as the  area pDdm  and AZ2  conjunctly.
   For  let PF  touch  the  circle  in P, and  produced  meet TN   in F;  arid pj
touch  the  ellipsis  in  p, and  produced  meet  the  same TN   in /, and  both
tangents  concur  in the  axis TQ,  at Y.  And   let ML  represent  the  space
which  the moon,  by the impulse  of the above-mentioned  force 3IT  or 3PK,
 would  describe  with  a transverse  motion,  in the meantime  while  revolving
 in the  circle  it describes  the  arc PM   ; and  ml  denote  the space which  the
moon  revolving  in the  ellipsis would  describe  in  the same  time  by the im
pulse  of  the same  force SIT  or 3PK   ; and -let LP  and  Ip be produced   till
they meet  the plane  of  the  ecliptic  in G  and  g, and FG  and  /"^ be joined,
of which FG  produced  may  cut  pf, pa;  and TQ,  in  c, e, and R  respect
ively  ; and/0"  produced  may  cut TQ   in r.  Because  the  force SIT  or 3PK
in the  circle  is to the  force SIT  or 3/?K in  the  ellipsis  as PK   to  /?K,  or
as AT   to «T,  the space ML  generated  by the former  force  will be  to the

space  ml  generated  by the  latter  as PK  to p"K ; that  is, because  of  the
similar  figures PYK/?  and FYRc,  as FR   to cR.  But  (because  of  the
similar  triangles PLM,  PGF)  ML   is to FG  as PL  to PG.  that  is (on  ac
count  of  the  parallels  L/r, PK,  GR),  as pi  to pe, that  is (because  of  the
similar  triangles  plm,  cpe), as lm  to  ce ; and  inversely  as LM   is to lm,  or
as FR   is to cR, so  is FG  to ce.  And  therefore  if fg  was  to  ce as///  to
cY,  that  is, as fr  to cR  (that  is, as fr  to FR   and FR   to cR  conjunctly,
that  is, as/T  to FT,  and FG   to  ce conjunctly),  because  the  ratio of FG
to  ce, expunged  on both  sides, leaves  the  ratios fg  to FG  and/T  to FT,
fg would  be  to FG  as/T  to FT;  and,  therefore,  the  angles  which  FG
and/£-  would  subtend  at the  earth T  would  be equal  to each other.  But
these  angles  (by what  we  have  shewn  in the preceding  Proposition)  are  the
motions  of  the  nodes, while  the moon  describes  in the  circle  the arc PM,
in the  ellipsis the  arc jt?w;  and  therefore  the  motions  of  the nodes  in the
circle and  in the  ellipsis would  be equal  to  each  other.  Thus,cexI say,/Y it

would  be, if fg  was  to  cc as/Y   to cY,  that  is, if/,r was  oqual to— ^                    .
But  because  of the similar  triangles/?/?,  cep, fg  is to  cc as//?  to cp ; anJ

therefore/?-  is equal to—  - —   ; and  therefore  the  angle  which fg  sub

tends  in fact  is to the former  angle which FG  subterds.  that  is to say, the
motion  of the  nodes  in tl;^  ellipsis is  to the motion  of  the same  in  the

therefore,  seeing  (by Corol.  1, Prop. XXX)   the latter  area  and AZ2  con-
junctly  are proportional  to the  horary motion  of  the nodes  in the  circle,
the former  area  and AZ2  conjunctly  will  be  proportional  to  the horary
motion  of  the nodes  in the ellipsis. Q.E.D.

the  areas />Drfm,  in the time  while  the moon   is carried  from  the quadra
ture  to any  place  tn, is the  area mpQ&d   terminated  at the tangent  of the
ellipsis Q,E  ; and  the  sum  of  all those  areas, in  oTne  entire  revolution,  is
the  area  of  the whole  ellipsis ; the mean  motion  of  the nodes  in the  ellip
sis  will be to the mean  motion  of the nodes  in the  circle  as the  ellipsis  to
the  circle ; that  is, as Ta  to TA,  or 69  to 70.  And,  therefore,  since  (by
Corol  2, Prop. XXX)   the mean  horary motion  of  the nodes  in the  circle
is to  16"  35"7  16iv. 36V.  as AZ2   to AT2,  if we  take  the angle  16"  21'"
3iv. 30V.  to the angle  16"  35'"  16iv. 36V.  as 69  to 70.  the mean  horary  mo
tion  of the  nodes  in  the  ellipsis  will  be  to 16"  21'"  3iv. 30V.  as AZ2   to
AT2  ; that  is, as the square  of the  sine  of  the distance  of  the node  from
the sun  to the square  of  the  radius.
   But  the moon,  by  a radius  drawn  to the  earth,  describes  the  area  in the
syzygie-s  with  a greater  velocity  than  it does  that  in the  quadratures,  and
upon  that  account  the  time  is contracted  in  the syzygies,  and  prolonged  in
the  quadratures  ; and  together  with  the  time  the motion  of  the nodes  is
likewise augmented  or diminished.  But  the moment  of  the  area  in the
quadrature  of the moon  was  to the moment  thereof  in the syzygies  as
10973  to 11073  ; and  therefore  the mean  moment  in the octants  is to the
excess  in the  syzygies.  and  to the  defect  in the quadratures,  as 1 1023,  the
half sum  of  those numbers,  to their  half  difference1 50.  Wherefore  since
the time  of  the moon  in the several  little equal  parts  of  its orbit  is recip

rocally  as  its velocity,  the mean  time  in the -octants  will  be to the  excess
of  the time  in the quadratures,  and  to  the  defect of  the lime  in the syzy
gies arising from  this  cause,  nearly  as 11023  to 50.  But, reckoning  from
the quadratures  to the  syzygies,  I find  that  the  excess  of  the moments  of
the  area,  in the  several  places above  the  least moment  in the  quadratures,
is nearly  as the square  of the  sine  of  the moon's  distance  from  the quad
ratures  : and  therefore  the  difference  betwixt  the moment   in any  place,
and  the mean  moment   in the  octants,  is as the  difference  betwixt  the square
of the  sine  of  the moon's  distance  from  the  quadratures,  and  the square
of  the  sine of 45  degrees,  or half  the  square  of the  radius  ; and  the in
crement  of  the time  in  the  several  places between  the octants  and quad
ratures,  and  the decrement  thereof  between  the octants  and  syzygies,  is in
the same  proportion.  But  the motion  of  the  nodes,  while  the moon  de
scribes  the  several  little equal  parts  of  its orbit, is accelerated  or retarded

| But the moo | n, by a rad | ius drawn to | the ear | th, describes the | area in the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| is nearly as th | e square of | the sine of t | he moon | 's distance fro | m the quad |

 in the duplicate  proportion  of  the time ; for that  motion,  while  the moou
describes PM,  is  (cceteris parilms)  as ML.  and ML   is in  the  duplicate
proportion  of  the time.  Wherefore  the motion  of the  nodes  in the syzy-
gj-es, in the  time  while  the moon  describes  given  little parts  of  its  orbit,
is diminished  in the duplicate  proportion  of the number  H07.'J  to the num
ber  11023:  and  the  decrement  is to  the remaining  motion  as 100  to
 10973  ; but  to the whole  motion  as 100  to 11073  nearly.  But  the  decre
ment  in the places between  the  octants  and  syzygies,  and  the increment  in
the places between  the octants  and  quadratures,  is to this decrement  nearly
as the  whole  motion  in these  places to  the whole  motion  in the  syzygies,
and  the  difference  betwixt  the square  of  the  sine of  the moon's  distance
from  the quadrature,  and  the half  square  of  the  radius,  to the half  square
of  the radius conjunctly.  Wherefore,  if the nodes  are  in the quadratures,
and  we  take  two  places,  one  on  one  side, one  on  the other, equally  distant
from  the  octant  and  other  two  distant  by the  same  interval,  one  from  the
syzygy,  the other from  the  quadrature,  and  from  the decrements  of  the
motions  in the two  places  between  the  syzygy  and  octant  we  subtract  the
increments  of the motions  in the two  other  places between  the  octant  and
the  quadrature,  the remaining  decrement  will  be  equal  to  the  decre
ment  in the  syzygy,  as  will  easily appear  by computation  ; and  therefore
the mean  decrement,  which  ought  to be subducted  from  the mean  motion
of the  nodes,  is the  fourth  part of the  decrement  in the syzygy.  The
whole  horary  motion  of the nodes  in the syzygies  (when  the moon  by  a  ra
dius drawn  to the earth  was  supposed  to describe  an  area  proportional  to
the time)  was  32"  42"'  ?iv. And  we  have  shewn  that  the decrement  of
the motion  of  the nodes, in  the time  while  the moon,  now  moving  with
greater  velocity,  describes  the same  space, was  to this motion  as 100  to
1.1073;  and  therefore  this  decrement  is 17'"  43iv. 11 v.  The  fourth  part
of which  4'"  25iv.  48V. subtracted  from  the mean  horary  motion  above
found,  16"  21//;  3iv. 30V.  leaves  16"  16'"  37iv. 42V. their  correct  mean  ho
rary  motion.
   If the nodes  are without  the quadratures,  and  two  places  are  considered,
one  on  one  side, one  on the  other, equally  distant  from  the  syzygies,  the
sum  of the motions  of  the  nodes, when  the moon  is in those  places,  will be
to the sum  of their motions,  when  the moon  is in the  same  places and  the
nodes  in  the quadratures,  as AZ2   to AT2.  And  the  decrements  of  the
motions  arising  from  the  causes  but  now  explained  will  be mutually  as
the motions  themselves,  and  therefore  the remaining  motions  will be mu
tually betwixt  themselves  as AZ2   to AT2   ; and  the mean  motions  will be
as the remaining  motions.  And,  therefore,  in  any  given  position  of  the
nodes,  their  correct mean  horary motion  is to 16"  16'"  37iv. 42V.  as AZ2
 to AT2  ; that  is, as the square  of  the  sine  of the  distance  of  the nodes
from  the syzygies  to the square  of the  radius.                                                          '    28

         PROPOSITION   XXXII.   PROBLEM   XIII.

             To find  the mean  motion  of  the nodes  of  the moon.

   The  yearly mean  motion   is the sum  of  all  the mean  horary  motions
throughout  the  course  of  the year.  Suppose  that  the node  is in N, and
that, after  every hour  is elapsed,  it  is drawn  back  again  to  its former
place;  so  that, notwithstanding   its proper  motion,  it may  constantly  re
main  in  the same  situation  with  respect  to the  fixed  stars;  while  in the
mean  time  the sun  S, by the motion  of the  earth,  is seen  to leave  the  node,
                                   and  to proceed  till it completes  its appa
                                       rent  annual  course  by an uniform  motion.
                                    Let Aa  represent  a given  least  arc, which
                                  the  right  line TS  always  drawn  to  the
                                   sun, by  its intersection  with  the  circle
                                    NA?/,  describes  in the  least given moment
                                    of time;  and  the mean  horary  motion
                                   (from  what  we  have  above  shewn)  will be
                                         as A Z2,  that  is (because AZ  and ZY   are
proportional),  as  the  rectangle  of AZ  into ZY.  that  is, as  the  area
AZYa   ; and  the sum  of  all the mean  horary  motions  from  the beginning
will  be  as the sum  of all the  areas oYZA,  that  is, as the area NAZ.   But
the  greatest AZYa   is equal  to the rectangle  of the  arc Aa  into  the radius
of  the  circle ; and  therefore  the  sum  of  all  these  rectangles  in the whole
circle  will  be  to the  like sum  of  all the  greatest  rectangles  as the area  of
the whole  circle  to the rectangle  of  the  whole  circumference  into  the  ra
dius, that  is, as  1 to 2.  But  the horary  motion  corresponding  to  that
greatest  rectangle  was  16"  16'"  37iv. 42V. and  this motion  in the complete
course  of  the  sidereal  year, 365d.  6".  9', amounts  to 39°  38' 7"  50"', and
therefore  the  half  thereof, 19°  49' 3"  55"',  is the mean  motion  of  the
nodes  corresponding  to  the  whole  circle.  And  the motion  of the nodes,
in the time  while  the sun  is carried  from  N  to A,  is to 19°  49' 3" 55"'  as
the  area NAZ   to the whole  circle.
  Thus  it would  be  if the node  was  after every hour  drawn  back  again  to

its former  place, that  so, after  a complete  revolution,  the sun  at the  year'send would  be found  again  in  the same  node  which  it had  left when  the
year begun.  But, because  of the motion  of the node  in the mean  time,  the
sun  must  needs  meet  the node  sooner  ; and  now  it remains  that we compute
the abbreviation  of  the time   Since,  then, the  sun, in  the course  of  the
year,  travels  360  degrees, and  the node  in the same  time  by  its greatest
motion  would  be carried  39 > 38' 7"  50'", or 39,6355  degrees ; and  the mean
motion  of the node  in any  place N  is to its mean  motion  in its quadratures
as AZ2   to AT-   • the motion  of  the sun  will be  to the motion  of the noda

| To fin | d the mean | motion | of the node | s of the moon. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The yearly me | an motion | is the | sum of all | the mean hor | ary motions |
| throughout the | course of th | e year. | Suppose | that the node | is in N, and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that, after every | hour is el | apsed, i | t is drawn | back again to | its former |
| place; so that, n | otwithstand | ing its | proper moti | on, it may co | nstantly re |
| main in the same | situation | with re | spect to the | fixed stars; w | hile in the |
| mean time the su | n S, b y the | motion | of the earth, | is seen to lea | ve the node, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | and | to proceed | till it complete | s its appa |
|  |  | rent | annual cou | rse by an unif | orm motion. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | Let | Aa represen | t a given leas | t arc, which |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | the | right line | TS always dr | awn to the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | sun | , by its in | tersection with | the circle |
|  |  | NA?/ | , describes | in the least gi | ven moment |
|  |  | of | time; and | the mean hor | ary motion |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | (fr | om what we | have above she | wn) will be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | as | A Z2, that is | (because AZ | and ZY are |
| proportional), as | the rectan | gle of | AZ into | ZY. that is, | as the area |
| AZYa ; and the | sum of all | the mea | n horary mo | tions from th | e beginning |
| will be as the sum | of all the | areas oY | ZA, that i | s, as the area | NAZ. But |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the greatest AZY | a is equal | to the r | ectangle of | the arc Aa int | o the radius |
| of the circle ; an | d therefore | the sum | of all the | se rectangles i | n the whole |
| circle will be to | the like sum | of all | the greatest | rectangles as | the area of |
| the whole circle | to the recta | ngle of | the whole | circumference | into the ra |
| dius, that is, as | 1 to 2. But | the h | orary moti | on correspond | ing to that |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| greatest rectangle | was 16" 16 | '" 37iv. | 42V. and th | is motion in t | he complete |
| course of the sid | ereal year, | 365d. 6". | 9', amount | s to 39° 38' 7 | " 50"', and |
| therefore the ha | lf thereof, 1 | 9° 49' | 3" 55"', is | the mean mot | ion of the |
| nodes correspond | ing to the | whole | circle. And | the motion o | f the nodes, |
| in the time while | the sun is | carried | from N to A | , is to 19° 49' | 3" 55"' as |
| the area NAZ to | the whole c | ircle. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Thus it would | be if the no | de was | after every | hour drawn ba | ck again to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | comp | lete revolu | tion, the sun a | t the year's |
| its former place, | that so, after | a
s | ame node w | hich it had le | ft when the |

| year begun. But | , because of | the mot | ion of the n | ode in the mea | n time, the |
| sun must needs m | eet the node | sooner | ; and now i | t remains that | we compute |
| the abbreviation | of the tim | e Sinc | e, then, the | sun, in the co | urse of the |
| year, travels 360 | degrees, and | the no | de in the | same time by | its greatest |
| motion would be | carried 39 > | 3 8' 7" 50 | '", or 39,63 | 55 degrees ; an | d the mean |

Wherefore  if we  suppose  the  circumference  NA/*  of  the whole  circle  to he
divided  into  little equal  parts, such  as Aa,  the  time  in which  the  sun  would
describe  the  little arc Aa,  if the  circle  was  quiescent,  will  be  to the  time  of
which  it would  describe  the same   arc, supposing  the  circle together  with

the nodes  to be revolved  about  the centre  T, reciprocally  as 9,0827646 AT2

to 9,082764 6 AT'2  + AZ2;  for  the  time  is reciprocally  as  the  velocity
with  which  the  little arc  is described,  and  this velocity  is the sum  of  the
velocities  of both  sun  and  node.   If, therefore,  the sector NTA   represent
the time  in which  the sun by  itself, without  the motion  of the node, would
describe  the  arc NA,  and  the  indefinitely  small  part ATa  of  the  sector
represent  the  little moment  of the time  in which   it would  describe  the  least
arc Aa  ; and  (letting  fall  a Y  perpendicular  upon  N//) if in AZ  we  take
c/Z  of such  length  that  the  rectangle  of dZ  into ZY  may  be  to the  least
part AT«   of  the  sector  as AZ2   to 9,OS27646AT2   -f AZ2,  that  is to
say, that dZ  may  be  to |AZ  as AT2   to 9,0827646 AT  2 -f AZ2  ; the
rectangle  of dZ  into ZY   will represent  the  decrement  of  the time  arising
from  the motion  of  the  node,  while  the  arc Aa   is described  ; and  if the
curve NdGn   is the  locus where  the point d  is always  found,  the curvilinear
area Ne/Z  will  be  as the whole  decrement  of time  while  the whole arcNA
is described  ; and;  therefore,  the  excess  of the  sector NAT   above  the  area
NrfZ  will  be  as the whole time  But  because  the motion  of the node  in  a

less time  is less in proportion  of the  time, the  area AaYZ  must  also  be di
minished  in the same  proportion  : which  may  be done  by taking  in AZ   the

line eZ  of such  length,  that  it may  be  to  the length  of AZ   as AZ2   to
9,OS27646AT2   -f AZ2  ; for  so  the  rectangle  of eZ  into ZY  will  be  to
the  area AZYa   as the decrement  of  the  time  in which  the  arc Aa  is de
scribed  to the whole  time  in which  it would  have  been  described,  if  the
node  had  been  quiescent  ; and,  therefore,  that  rectangle  will  be  as the de
crement  of the motion  of the node.  And  if the curve NeFn   is the locus  of

the point  e, the whole  area NeZ,  which  is the sum  of all the decrements  of
that motion,  will  be  as  the whole  decrement  thereof  during  the  time  in
which  the  arc AN   is described  ; and  the remaining  area  N Ae  will  be as the
remaining  motion,  which  is the  true  motion  of  the node, during  the time
in which  the whole  arc NA   is described  by the  joint motions  of both  sun
and node.  Now  the  area  of the  semi-circle  is to  the  area  of  the figure
NeFn  found  by the method  of infinite  series nearly  as 793  to o-\  But  the
motion  corresponding  or proportional  to  the whole  circle was  19°  49' 3"

the eccentricity  of the moon's  orbit, and  its inclination  to the plane of  the
ecliptic. By  the eccentricity  of  this  orbit  the motion  of  the nodes  is too
much  accelerated  ; and, on  the other  hand, by the inclination  of  the  orbit,
the motion  of  the  nodes  is something  retarded,  and  reduced  to  its just
velocity.

                                           culus  is too  difficult,  it will  be better
                                                 to use  the  following  construction  of
                                        the Problem.  About  the  centre  C,

with  any  interval CD,  describe  the  circle BEFD   ; produce DC   to A  so  as
AB  may  be  to AC   as the mean  motion  to half  the mean  true  motion  when
the nodes  are  in their quadratures  (that  is, as 19°  18' I" 23'"  to 19°  49' 3"
55'"  ; and  therefore BC  to AC  as  the difference  of those  motions  0G Jl' 2"
32'"  to the  latter  motion  19°  49' 3"  55'",  that  is, as 1 to 38T\).  Then
through  the  point D  draw  the  indefinite  line Gg,  touching  the  circle  in.
I) ; and  if we  take  the angle BCE,  or BCF,  equal  to  the double  distance
of the sun  from  the  place  of the  node,  as found  by the mean  motion,  and
drawing AE  or AF  cutting  the  perpendicular DG   in G, we  take  another
angle which  shall  be  to the whole  motion  of  the node  in  the interval  be

tween  its syzygies  (that  is, to 9° IV  3") as the tangent DG   to  the whole
circumference  of  the  circle BED,  and  add  this last  angle  (for which  the
angle DAG  may  be used)  to the mean  motion  of  the nodes,  while  they  are
passing  from  the quadratures  to  the  syzygies, and  subtract  it from  their
mean  motion  while  they  are  passing  from  the syzygies  to the quadratures,
we  shall have  their  true motion  ; for the true  motion  so found  will nearly
agree  with  the  true motion  which  comes  out from  assuming  the times  as
the area NTA — NrfZ,  and  the motion  of  the  node  as  the  area NAe  ; as
whoever  will please  to examine  and  make  the computations  will  find : and
this  is the semi -menstrual  equation  of the motion  of the nodes.  But  there
is also  a menstrual  equation,  but which  is by no  means  necessary  for  find-

ing of the moon's  latitude ; for since  the variation  of the inclination  of the
moon's  orbit  to the plane of  the  ecliptic  is liable  to a twofold  inequality,
the one  semi-menstrual,  the  other  menstrual,  the menstrual  inequality  of
this variation,  and  the menstrual  equation  of the  nodes,  so moderate  and
carrect  each  other,  that  in computing  the  latitude  of the moon  both may
 be neglected.
   COR.  From  this and  the  preceding  Prop,  it appears  that  the nodes  are
quiescent  in  their  syzygies,  but  regressive  in  their  quadratures,  by  an
hourly  motion  of 16"  19'"  26iv.  : and  that the  equation  of the motion  of
the nodes  in the octants  is 1° 30' ; all which  exactly  agree  with  the phaB-
nomena  of  the heavens.

                     SCHOLIUM.

   Mr. Machin,  Astron.,  Prof.  Gresh..  and  Dr.  Flenry  Pemberton,  sepa
rately found  out  the motion  of the nodes  by a different method.  Mention
has  been made  of this method  in another  place.  Their  several  papers, both
of which  I have  seen, contained  two  Propositions,  and  exactly  agreed  with

each  other  in both  of them.  Mr. Machines  paper coming  first to my  hands,
I shall  here  insert  it.



 OF THE  MOTION  OF THE  MOON'S  NODES.
                                  < PROPOSITION    I.

1 The mean  motion  of  the  sir/i from  the  node  is defined  by  a geometric
  mean  proportional  between  the mean  motion  of the sun  and  that mean
   motion,  with  which  the sun  recedes  with  the greatest  swiftness from  the
   node  in the quadratures.

   " Let T  be  the  earth's  place, Nn  the  line of  the  moon's  nodes  at  any
aiven  time, KTM   a  perpendicular  thereto, TA   a  right  line  revolving
about  the centre  with  the  same  angular  velocity  with which  the sun  and

of  the  velocities  with  which  the sun  and  node  are  carried  two  different

ways  in  that  time.  Now  the  sun's  velocity  is almost  uniform,  its ine
quality  being  so  small  as  scarcely  to produce  the  least inequality  in  the
mean  motion  of the nodes.  The  other  part  of this sum,  namely,  the mean
quantity  of the  velocity  of  the node,  is increased  in  the recess from  the
gyzygies  in a duplicate  ratio  of the sine  of  its distance  from  the  sun  (by

the rectangle KHM    is to HT2   as FB/  to BG2,  and  the rectangle  AB(3  is
equal  to  the  rectangle  FB/,  therefore  the  little  area ABba,  where  it is
greatest,  is to  the remaining  sector TB6  as  the  rectangle  AB/3  to BG2
But  the  ratio  of these  little areas  always  was  as the  rectangle AB#   to

correspondent  little area  in the quadratures  in  the duplicate  ratio  cf BG

which  the sun  hath  been  going  over  the  arc NA  since  he  left the  node;
and  the remaining  space, namely,  the  elliptic  sector NTB,  will  be as  die
sun's mean  motion  in the same  time.  And  because  the mean  annual  mo

          PROPOSITION   XXXV.   PROBLEM   XVI.

 To  a given  time  to find  the inclination  of  the moo  i is  orbit  to the plant
                                of  the  ecliptic.
   Let AD  be the  sine of  the greatest  inclination,  and AB  the  sine of  the
 least.  Bisect BD  in C ; and  round  the  centre  C, with  the interval BC,
 describe  the  circle BGD.   In AC  take CE  in  the same  proportion  to EB





                                     B \ HA   EC




 as EB  to twice BA.  And  if to  the time  given  we  set  off the angle AEG
equal  to double  the distance  of the  nodes  from  the quadratures,  and  upon
AD   let fall the perpendicular  GH, AH  will  be the  sine  of  the inclination
 required.
   For GE2   is equal  to GH2  + HE2  = BHD  + HE2  = HBD   4- HE2
__ BH3  = HBD  + BE2  —  2BH  X BE  =  BE2  + 2EC  X BH  =  SEC
 X AB  + 2EC  X BH  =  2EC  X AH;  wherefore  since 2EC   is given. GE2
will be as AH.  Now   let AEg-  represent  double  the distance  of  the nodes
from  the quadratures,  in  a given moment   of time  after, and  the  arc G^,  on
account  of  the given  angle GE^-,  will  be  as the distance GE.   But  HA  is
to GO-  as GH   to GC,  and, therefore, HA  is as the rectangle GH  X  G^,  or

GH  x  GE,  that  is, as ^   X GE2,  or 7^ljr_ti  X AH:  that  is, as AH   and

the sine of  the angle AEG  conjunctly.  If, therefore,  in any  one  case. AH
be the  sine of  inclination,  it will  increase  by  the same  increments  as the
bine  of inclination  doth, by Cor.  3 of the preceding  Prop,  and  therefore  will
always  continue  equal  to that  sine.  But  when  the  point G  falls upon
Cither  point  B  or D, AH   is equal  to this  sine, and  therefore  remains  always
equal thereto.  Q.E.D.
   In  this demonstration  I have  supposed  that  the angle BEG,  representing
double  the distance  of the nodes  from  the quadratures,  increaseth  uniform
ly ; for  I cannot  descend  to every  minute  circumstance  of inequality.  Now
suppose  that BEG   is a  right  angle, and  that Gg  is in  this  case  the ho
rary increment  of double  the  distance  of  the nodes  from  the  sun  ; then, by
Cor.  3 of the  last Prop,  the horary  variation  of the inclination  in the same
case  will  be to 33"  10"'  33iv.  as the rectangle  of AH,  the  sine  of the  incli
nation,  into  the  sine of  the  right angle BEG,  double  the  distance  of  the
nodes  from  the  sun,  to four  times  the square  of the  radius  ; that  is, as AH,

 the sine of the mean  inclination,  to  four  times  the radius;  that  is, seeing
 the mean  inclination  is about  5° S£, as  its sine 896  to 40000,  the quad
ruple of  the radius,  or  as 224  to 10000.  But  the whole  variation  corres
ponding  to BD,  the difference  of  the  sines, is to  this horary  variation  as
 the diameter BU   to the  arc G%,  that  is, conjunctly  as the diameter BD   to
the semi- circumference  BGD,  and  as  the time  of 2079T\  hours,  in which
the node  proceeds  from  the quadratures  to  the  syzyffies,  to one  hour,  that
is as 7 to  11, and  2079 T\ to 1.  Wherefore,  compounding  all  these  pro
portions,  we  shall have  the whole  variation BD  to 33"  10"'  33iv. as 224  X
7 X  2079T\  to 110000,  that  is, as 29645  to 1000;  and  from  thence  that
variation BD  will come  out  16' 23i".
  And  this  is the greatest  variation  of  the  inclination,  abstracting  from
the situation  of the moon  in  its orbit:  for  if the nodes  are  in the syzygies,
the inclination  suffers  no change  from  the various  positions  of the  moon.
But  if the nodes  are in  the  quadratures,  the  inclination  is  less when  the
moon  is in the syzygies  than  when  it is in the quadratures  by a difference

of  2' 43",  as we shewed  in Cor.  4 of  the preceding  Prop. ; and  the whole
mean  variation  BD,  diminished  by  1' 21 i", the  half  of this  excess, becomes
 15' 2", when  the moon  is in the quadratures:  and  increased  by  the same,
becomes  17' 45"  when  the moon  is in  the  syzygies.  If, therefore,  the
moon  be in the syzygies,  the whole  variation  in  the  passage  of  the  nodes
from  the quadratures  to the syzygies  will  be  17' 45"  ; and, therefore,  if the
inclination  be 5°  17' 20", when  the nodes  are  in the  syzygies,  it will  be 4°
59' 35"  when  the nodes  are  in the quadratures  and  the moon  in the syzy
gies.  The  truth  of  all which  is confirmed  by observations.
  Now   if the inclination  of the  orbit should  be required when  the moon  is
in the syzygies,  and  the nodes  any  where  between  them  and  the quadratures,
let AB  be to AD   as the  sine of  4°  59' 35"  to the  sine  of  5°  17' 20", and
take  the angle AEG  equal  to double  the  distance  of  the  nodes  from  the
quadratures  ; and AH   will  be the  sine  of the inclination  desired.  To  this
inclination  of the orbit  the inclination  of the same  is equal, when  the moon
is 90°  distant  from  the nodes.  In other  situations  of  the moon,  this men
strual  inequality,  to which  the variation  of the inclination  is obnoxious  in
the calculus  of  the moon's  latitude,  is balanced,  and  in  a manner  took  off,
by  the menstrual  inequality  of  the  motion  of  the  nodes  (as we  said
before), and  therefore may  be neglected  in  the computation  of the  said
latitude.

                     SCHOLIUM.

  By  these computations  of  the lunar  motions  I was  willing  to shew  that
by the theory  of gravity  the motions  of the moon  could  be calculated  from
their physical causes.  By  the same  theory  I moreover  found  that  the  an
nual  equation  of  the mean  motion  of  the moon  arises from  the various

| And this | is the | great | est variat | ion of the incl | ination, abst | racting from |
| the situation | of t | he moo | n in its o | rbit: for if the n | odes are in | the syzygies, |
| the inclinati | on su | ffers n | o change | from the various | positions o | f the moon. |
| But if the n | odes | are in | the quad | ratures, the incl | ination is l | ess when the |
| moon is in | the sy | zygies | than whe | n it is in the qu | adratures by | a difference |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 15' 2", when | the | moon | is in the | quadratures: an | d increased | by the same, |
| becomes 17' | 45" | when | the moo | n is in the syz | ygies. If, t | herefore, the |
| moon be in | the sy | zygies, | the whol | e variation in | the passage o | f the nodes |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from the qua | dratu | res to | the syzyg | ies will be 17' 4 | 5" ; and, ther | efore, if the |

| 59' 35" when | the | nodes | are in th | e quadratures an | d the moon | in the syzy |

 dilatation  which  the  orbit  of  the moon  suffers from  the action  of  the  sun
 according  to Cor.  6, Prop. LXVI.  Book  I.  The  force  of this  action  is

 greater  in the perigeon  sun, and  dilates  the  moon's  orbit ; in the apogeon
sun  it is  less, and permits  the  orbit  to be again  contracted.  The  moon
 moves  slower  in the  dilated  and  faster  in  the contracted  orbit  ; and  the
 annual  equation, by which  this  inequality  is regulated,  vanishes  in  the
 apogee  and  perigee  of the sun.  In the mean  distance  of the sun  from  the

 earth  it arises  to about  11' 50"  ; in other  distances  of  the  sun  it is pro
portional  to  the  equation  of  the sun's  centre, and  is added  to the mean
motion  of  the moon,  while  the  earth  is passing  .from  its aphelion  to  its
perihelion, and  subducted  while  the  earth  is in  the  opposite  semi-circle.
Taking  for the radius  of  the  or bis niagnus  1000,  and  16}  for the  earth's
eccentricity,  this  equation,  when  of  the greatest  magnitude,  by the theory
of gravity  comes  out  11' 49".  But  the eccentricity  of  the earth  seems  to
be something  greater,  and  with  the eccentricity  this equation  will  be aug
mented  in the same  proportion.  Suppose  the  eccentricity  16}^, and  the
greatest  equation  will be  11' 51".
   Farther  ; I found  that  the apogee  and  nodes  of  the moon  move   fastei

in the perihelion  of the  earth, where  the  force  of the  sun's  action  is greater,
than  in the  aphelion  thereof, and  that  in the reciprocal  triplicate propor
tion  of  the  earth's  distance from  the  sun  ; and  hence  arise  annual  equa
tions  of those  motions  proportional  to  the  equation  of  the  sun's  centre.
Now  the motion  of the sun  is in the reciprocal  duplicate  proportion  of the

earth's  distance  from  the  sun  ; and  the- greatest  equation  of  the  centre
which  this inequality  generates  is 1° 56' 20", corresponding  to the above-
mentioned  eccentricity  of  the  sun, 16}£.  But  if the motion  of the  sun
had  been  in  the reciprocal  triplicate proportion  of  the distance,  this ine

quality would  have  generated  the  greatest  equation  2°  54' 30"  ; and  there
fore  the  greatest  equations  which  the  inequalities  of  the motions  of  the
moon's  apogee  and  nodes  do  generate  are  to 2° 54' 30"  as the mean  diur
nal motion  of the  moon's  apogee  and  the mean  diurnal  motion  of  its
nodes  are  to the mean  diurnal  motion  of  the sun.  Whence  the  greatest

equation  of the mean  motion  of  the apogee  comes  out  19' 43", and  the
greatest  equation  of  the mean  motion  of the  nodes  9' 24".  The  former
equation  is added, and  the  latter  subducted,  while  the  earth  is passing
from  its perihelion  to its aphelion,  and  contrariwise  when  the earth  is in
the  opposite  semi-circle.
  By  the  theory  of gravity  I likewise  found  that  the  action  of  the  sun
upon  the moon  is something  greater  when  the  transverse  diameter  of  the
moon's  orbit  passeth through  the sun  than  when  the same  is perpendicu
lar upon  the  line which  joins  the earth  and  the  sun  ; and  therefore  the
moon's  orbit  is something  larger  in  the former  than  in  the  latter  case.
And  hence  arises another  equation  of  the moon's  moan  motion,  depending

446           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III

upon  the situation  of  the moon's  apogee  in respect  of  the  sun, which  is in
its greatest  quantity  when  the moon's  apogee  is in the  octants  of  the  sun,
and  vanishes  when  the apogee  arrives  at the quadratures  or syzygies  ; and

it is added  to the  mean  motion  while  the moon's  apogee  is passing  from
the quadrature  of the  sun  to the syzygy,  and  subducted  while  the apogee
is passing  from  the syzygy  to  the quadrature.  This  equation, which  I
shall  call  the semi-annual,  when  greatest  in  the  octants  of the  apogee,
arises  to about  3' 45",  so far  as I could  collect from  the phenomena   : and
this  is its quantity  in the mean  distance  of  the sun  from  the earth.  But
it is increased  and  diminished  in  the  reciprocal  triplicate  proportion  of
the sun's  distance, and  therefore  is nearly  3' 34" when  that  distance  is
greatest^  and  3' 56"  when  least.  But  when  the moon's  apogee  is without
the octants,  it becomes  less, and  is  to its greatest  quantity  as the sine  of

double  the distance  of the moon's  apogee  from  the nearest  syzygy  or quad
rature  to the  radius.
  By  the same  theory  of gravity,  the  action  of  the sun  upon  the moon   is

something  greater  when  the  line of  the moon's  nodes  passes  through  the
sun  than  when  it is at right angles  with  the  line which  joins  the sun  and

the  earth  ; and  hence  arises another  equation  of the moon's  mean  motion,
which  I shall  call  the second  semi-annual  ; and  this  is greatest when  the
nodes  are  in  the  octants  of  the  sun, and  vanishes  when  they  are  in the
syzygies  or  quadratures  ; and  in  other  positions  of the  nodes  is propor
tional  to the  sine  of double  the  distance  of either  node  from  the  nearest
syzygy  or quadrature.  And  it is added  to the mean  motion  of the  moon,
if the  sun  is in  antecedentia,  to  the  node  which  is nearest  to him,  and
subducted  if in  consequential  and  in  the  octants, where  it  is of  the
greatest  magnitude,  it arises  to 47"  in  the mean  distance  of  the sun  from
the  earth,  as I find from  the theory  of gravity.  In other  distances  of  the
sun,  this equation,  greatest  in  the  octants  of  the nodes,  is reciprocally  as
the cube  of  the  sun's  distance  from  the  earth  ; and  therefore  in the  sun's
perigee  it comes  to about  49", and  in  its apogee  to about  45".
  By  the same  theory  of gravity,  the moon's  apogee  goes  forward  at  the
greatest  rate when  it is either  in conjunction  with  or  in opposition  to  the
sun, but  in its quadratures  with  the sun  it goes backward  ; and  the  ec
centricity  comes,  in the former  case, to its greatest  quantity  ; in the  latter
to its  least, by  Cor.  7, 8, and  9, Prop. LXVI,  Book  1.  And  those  ine
qualities, by the Corollaries  we  have  named,  are  very  great, and  generate
the principal  which  I call  the semi-annual  equation  of  the apogee  ; and
this semi-annual  equation  in  its greatest  quantity  comes  to about  12°  18',
as  nearly  as  I could  collect from  the phenomena.  Our  countryman,

HorroXj  was  the  first who  advanced  the theory  of  the moon's  moving  in
an  ellipsis about  the  earth  placed  in  its lower focus.  Dr. Halley  improved
the notion, by putting  the centre  of  the  ellipsis in  an  epicycle whose  cen-

| and vanishes | when | the apogee ar | rives at t | he quadr | atures or syz | ygie | s ; and |

| it is added to | the | mean motion | while the | moon's | apogee is pa | ssin | g from |
| the quadrature | of | the sun to th | e syzygy, | and sub | ducted while | the | apogee |
| is passing fr | om | the syzygy to | the quad | rature. | This equatio | n, | which I |
| shall call the | sem | i-annual, when | greatest | in the | octants of | the | apogee, |
| arises to about | 3' | 45", so far as | I could co | llect fro | m the pheno | mena | : and |
| this is its quan | tit | y in the mean | distance | of the su | n from the | eart | h. But |
| it is increased | an | d diminished i | n the rec | iprocal | triplicate pr | opor | tion of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the sun's dist | ance | , and therefore | is near | ly 3' 34" | when that | dis | tance is |
| greatest^ and | 3' 5 | 6" when least. | But wh | en the m | oon's apogee | is | without |
| the octants, it | be | comes less, and | is to its | greatest | quantity as | the | sine of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| double the dis | tanc | e of the moon's | apogee | from the | nearest syzy | gy o | r quad |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rature to the | radiu | s. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| By the same | th | eory of gravity | , the act | ion of th | e sun upon | the | moon is |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| something gr | eate | r when the line | of the m | oon's no | des passes | thro | ugh the |
| sun than when | it | is at right angl | es with | the line | which joins | the | sun and |

| the earth ; an | d he | nce arises anot | her equat | ion of t | he moon's me | an | motion, |

| tional to the | sine | of double the | distance | of eithe | r node from | the | nearest |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| syzygy or qua | dra | ture. And it i | s added t | o the mea | n motion of | the | moon, |

| subducted if | in | consequential | and in | the octan | ts, where i | t is | of the |

| greatest magni | tude | , it arises to 4 | 7" in th | e mean d | istance of t | he su | n from |
| the earth, as | I fin | d from the theo | ry of gr | avity. I | n other dista | nces | of the |

epicycle  the mentioned  inequalities  in the progress  and  regress  of the apo

                                        according  to the order  of  the  letters
                            BDA.   Set  off the angle BCD  equal
                                      to  twice  the  annual  argument,   or

twice  the distance  of  the sun's  true  place from  the place  of the  moon's
apogee  once  equated, and CTD   will  be the semi-annual  equation  of  the
moon's  apogee,  and TO   the  eccentricity  of  its orbit, tending  to  the place
of  the apogee  now  twice  equated.  But, having  the moon's  mean  motion,
the  place of  its apogee,  and  its eccentricity,  as  well  as the longer  axis  of
its orbit 200000,  from  these data  the true  place of the moon  in its orbit,
together  with  its  distance  from  the  earth, may  be determined  by  the
methods  commonly  known.
   In the  perihelion  of  the  earth, where  the  force of  the sun  is greatest,
the centre  of the moon's  orbit moves  faster  about  the centre C  than  in the

aphelion,  and  that  in the reciprocal  triplicate proportion  of  the sun's  dis

                           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III

 the moon's  orbit comes  to describe  a certain  curve  line about  the centre C
 with  a velocity which  will be almost  reciprocally  as  the cube  of  the  sun's
 distance  from  the earth,  as it ought  to be.
   The  calculus  of  this motion  is difficult, but may  be  rendered  more  easy
 by the following approximation.  Assuming,  as  above,  the moon's  mean
 distance  from  the earth  of 100000  parts, and  the eccentricity TC  of 5505
 Buch  parts,  the-line CB  or CD  will  be found  1172f,  and DF  35}  of those
 parts : and  this line DF  at the distance TC  subtends  the angle  at the earth,
 which  the removal  of the centre  of the  orbit from  the place D  to the place
 P generates  in the motion  of  this centre;  and  double  this  line DF  in  a
 parallel  position,  at the distance  of the upper  focus  of the moon's  orbit from
 the earth, subtends  at the  earth  the same  angle  as DF  did  before, which
 that removal  generates  in the motion  of  this upper  focus ; but  at the  dis
 tance  of the moon  from  the earth  this double  line 2DF   at the upper  focus,
 in a parallel position  to the  first line DF,  subtends  an  angle  at the moon,
 which  the said removal  generates  in the motion  of the moon,  which  angle
may  be therefore  called  the second  equation  of the moon's  centre ; and  this
 equation,  in the mean  distance  of the moon  from  the  earth,  is nearly  as the
sine of the  angle which  that  line DF  contains  with  the  line drawn  from
 the point F  to the moon,  and when  in  its greatest  quantity  amounts  to 2'
25".  But  the angle which  the  line DF  contains  with  the  line drawn  from
the point F  to the moon  is found  either  by subtracting  the  angle EDF
from  the mean  anomaly  of the moon,  or by adding  the distance  of the moon

from  the sun  to the distance  of  the moon's  apogee  from  the apogee  of  the
sun ; and  as the radius  to the sine of the angle  thus  found,  so is 2' 25"  to
the second  equation  of  the centre:  to be added,  if the forementioned  sum
be less than  a semi-circle  ; to be subducted,  if greater.  And  from  the moon's
place  in its orbit  thus  corrected,  its longitude may  be found  in the syzygies
of  the luminaries.
   The  atmosphere  of the earth  to the height  of 35  or 40 miles  refracts  the

sun's light.  This  refraction  ^scatters and  spreads  the  light over  the  earth's
shadow  ; and  the  dissipated^ light near  the limits  of the shadow  dilates  the
shadow.  Upon  which  account,  to  the diameter  of  the shadow,  as  it cornea
out by the parallax,  I add  1 or 1^ minute  in lunar  eclipses.
   But  the theory  of  the moon  ought  to be examined  and  proved  from  the
phenomena,   first in the syzygies,  then  in the  quadratures,  and  last of  all
in the  octants:  and whoever  pleases  to undertake  the work  will  find  it
not  amiss  to assume  the following  mean  motions  of the  sun  and moon  at
the Royal  Observatory  of Greenwich,  to the  last day  of December  at noon,
anno  1700,  O.S. viz.  The  mean  motion  of the sun  Y5> 20°  43' 40", and  of
its apogee  s  7° 44' 30";  the mean  motion  of the moon  ^  15°  21' 00";
of  its apogee, X  8° 20' 00";  and  of  its ascending  node  Si 27°  24' 20";
and  the  difference  of meridians  betwixt  the Observatory  at Greenwich  and

| parts : and th | is line DF a | t the distance | TC subtend | s the angle | at t | he earth, |
| which the re | moval of the | centre of the | orbit from | the place D | to | the place |
| P generates i | n the motio | n of this ce | ntre; and d | ouble this | line | DF in a |
| parallel positi | on, at the di | stance of the | upper focus | of the moon' | s or | bit from |

| which the sai | d removal ge | nerates in th | e motion of | the moon, | whic | h angle |
| may be theref | ore called th | e second equa | tion of the | moon's cent | re ; | and this |

        PROPOSITION   XXXVI.   PROBLEM   XVII.

                 To find  the force  of  the sun  to move  the  sea.
  The  sun's  force Ml,  or PT   to disturb  the motions  of the moon,  was  (by
Prop. XXV.)  in the moon's  quadratures,  to the  force  of gravity  with  us,  as
1 to 638092.6;  and  the  force TM  —  LM   or 2PK   in  the moon's  syzygies
is double  that quantity.  But, descending  to the surface  of the  earth,  these
forces  are diminished  in proportion  of the distances  from  the  centre  of  the
earth, that  is, in the proportion  of 60|  to 1 ; and  therefore  the former  force

on  the  earth's  surface  is to the  force  of gravity  as 1 to 38604600  ; and by
this  force  the  sea  is depressed  in such  places  as  are 90 degrees  distant  from
the sun.  But  by the  other  force, which  is twice  as great,  the  sea  is raised
not  only  in the places  directly under  the  sun, but  in those  also which  are
directly opposed  to it ; and  the sum  of these  forces  is to the force  of gravity
as 1 to 12868200.  And  because  the same  force  excites  the same  motion,
whether   it depresses  the waters  in those  places which  are 90 degrees  distant
from  the  sun,  or  raises them  in the  places which  are  directly under  and  di
rectly opposed  to the  sun, the  aforesaid  sum  will  be  the  total  force  of  the
sun  to disturb  the  sea, and  will have  the same  effect  as if the whole  was
employed  in raising  the  sea  in  the  places  directly under  and  directly  op
posed  to the  sun,  and  did  not  act  at all in the  places which  are 90  degrees
removed  from  the  sun.
   And  this  is the  force  of the  sun  to disturb  the  sea  in any  given  place,
where  the sun  is at the same  time  both  vertical, and  in  its mean  distance
from  the earth.  In  other  positions  of the  sun,  its force  to raise  the  sea  is
 as the versel  sine  of double  its altitude  above  the horizon  of the place  di
 rectly, and  the  cu.be of  the distance  from  the earth  reciprocally.
   COR.  Since  the centrifugal  force  of  the parts  of  the  earth,  arising from
 the  earth's  diurnal  motion,  which  is to the  force  of gravity  as 1 to 289,
 raises  the waters  under  the  equator  to a height  exceeding  that under  the
 poles by 85472  Paris  feet, as  above,  in Prop. XIX.,  the  force  of the  sun,
 which  we  have  now  shewed  to be  to the  force  of gravity  as 1 to 12868200,
 and  therefore  is to  that  centrifugal  force  as 289  to 12868200,  or  as 1 to
 44527,  will  be  able  to raise  the waters  in the places  directly  under  and  di
 rectly opposed  to the sun  to a height  exceeding  that  in the places which  arc
 90 degrees removed  from  the sun  only by one Paris  foot and  113¥V  inches ;
 for  this measure  is to the measure  of 85472  feet  as 1 to 44527.

tion  to the  force  of the  sun,  and  this proportion  is to he collected  from  the
proportion  of  the motions  of  the  sea, which  are  the  effects of  those  forces.
Before  the mouth  of the  river  Avon,  three  miles  below  Bristol,  the height
of  the  ascent  of  the water  in the vernal  and  autumnal  syzygies  of  the  lu
minaries  (by the  observations  of Samuel  Sturmy}  amounts  to about  45
feet, but  in  the quadratures  to 25 only.  The  former  of those  heights  ari
ses from  the sum  of the  aforesaid  forces, the  latter  from  their  difference.
If, therefore,  S and L  are  supposed  to represent  respectively  the  forces  of
the sun  arid moon  while  they  are  in the  equator,  as  well  as  in their mean
distances  from  the  earth,  we  shall have  L + S  to L —  S  as 45  to 25,  or  as
9 to 5.
   At Plymouth  (by the observations  of Samuel  Colepress)  the  tide in  its
mean  height  rises  to about  16  feet, and  in  the  spring  and autumn   tlu-
height  thereof  in the syzygies  may  exceed  that  in the quadratures  by more
than  7 or 8 feet.  Suppose  the  greatest  difference  of  those  heights  to be 9
feet, and  L  -f S will  be  to L —  S  as 20 £ to ll|,  or  as 41  to 23;  a pro
portion  that  agrees  well enough  with  the former.  But  because  of the great
tide  at Bristol,  we  are  rather  to depend  upon  the observations  of Sturmy  ;
and,  therefore,  till we  procure  something  that  is more  certain,  we  shall  use
the proportion  of 9 to 5.
   But  because  of the reciprocal  motions  of the waters,  the greatest  tides do
not happen  at the times  of the syzygies  of  the luminaries,  but,  as we have
said  before,  are  the  third  in  order  after  the  syzygies  ; or (reckoning  from
the syzygies)  follow  next  after the  third  appulse  of the moon  to  the me
ridian  of  the place  after  the syzygies ; or  rather  (as Sturmy  observes)  are
 the  third  after  the day  of  the new  or full moon,  or rather  nearly  after  the
 twelfth  hour  from  the new  or full moon,  and  therefore  fall nearly upon  the
forty-third  hour  after  the new  or full  of the moon.  But  in this port they
 fall out  about  the seventh  hour  after  the appulse  of  the moon  to  the me
 ridian  of  the  place ; and  therefore  follow  next  after  the  appulse  of  the
moon  to  the meridian,  when  the moon  is distant  from  the  sun,  or from  op
 position  with  the sun  by about  IS  or 19  degrees  in. consequent-la.  So  the
summer  and  winter  seasons  come  not  to their height  in the  solstices them
 selves, but when  the sun  is advanced  beyuni  the  solstices by about  a tenth
 part  of its whole  course,  that  is, by about  36  or 37 degrees.  In like man
 ner, the greatest  tide  is raised  after  the appulse  of the moon  to the meridian
 of the  place, when  the moon  has passed  by the  sun,  or the opposition  thereof.
 by .about  a tenth  part of  the whole  motion  from  one  greatest  tide  to  the
 next following  greatest  tide.  Suppose  that  distance  about  18^  degrees:
 and  the sun's  force in  this  distance  of  the moon  from  the syzygies  and
 quadratures  will  be of  less moment  to augment  and  diminish  that  part  o1
 the motion  of the  sea  which  proceeds  from  the motion  of the moon  than  in

| At Plymouth | (by the o | bservations of Sa | muel Cole | press) the | tide in its |

| than 7 or 8 feet | . Suppose | the greatest dif | ference of | those heigh | ts to be 9 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| feet, and L -f S | will be t | o L — S as 20 | £ to ll|, or | as 41 to 2 | 3; a pro |
| portion that agre | es well en | ough with the fo | rmer. But | because of | the great |
| tide at Bristol, w | e are rath | er to depend up | on the obse | rvations of | Sturmy ; |
| and, therefore, t | ill we proc | ure something t | hat is more | certain, we | shall use |
| the proportion o | f 9 to 5. |  |  |  |  |
| But because o | f the recip | rocal motions of | the waters, | the greates | t tides do |
| not happen at th | e times of | the syzygies of | the luminar | ies, but, a | s we have |
| said before, are | the third i | n order after th | e syzygies | ; or (recko | ning from |
| the syzygies) fol | low next a | fter the third a | ppulse of | the moon | to the me |
| ridian of the pl | ace after t | he syzygies ; or | rather (as | Sturmy ob | serves) are |
| the third after t | he day of | the new or full | moon, or ra | ther nearly | after the |
| twelfth hour fro | m the new | or full moon, an | d therefore | fall nearly | upon the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| forty-third hour | after the | new or full of th | e moon. | But in this | port they |
| fall out about th | e seventh | hour after the a | ppulse of | the moon | to the me |

proportion  of 10000000   to 798)355;  and, therefore,  in the preceding  an
alogy,  in place of S we  must  put 0,79863558.
   But  farther ; the force  of  tne moon  in the quadratures  must  be dimin
ished, on  account  of  its declination  from  the  equator ; for  the moon  in
those  quadratures,  or rather  in 18^ degrees  past  the quadratures,  declines

from  the equator  by about  23°  13'; and  the  force  of  either luminary  to
move  the  sea  is diminished  as  it declines  from  the equator  nearly  in the
duplicate  proportion  of  the co-sine  of the  declination  ; and  therefore  the
force  of the moon  in those  quadratures  is only 0.85703271.  ; whence  we
have L+0,7986355S   to 0,8570327L  —  0,79863558  as 9 to 5.
   Farther  yet ; the diameters  of the orbit  in which  the moon  should  move,
setting  aside  the  consideration  of  eccentricity,  are  one  to the other  as 69

to 70  ; and  therefore  the moon's  distance  from  the  earth  in the syzygies
is to  its distance  in the quadratures,  c&teris  paribus,  as 69  to 70 ; and  its
distances, when  18i  degrees advanced  beyond  the syzygies, where  the great
est  tide was  excited, and  when  18^  degrees  passed  by  the quadratures,
where  the  least  tide  was  produced,  are  to its mean  distance  as 69,098747
and  69,£97345  to 69 1.  But  the  force  of  the moon  to move  the sea  is in
the  reciprocal  triplicate  proportion  of  its distance ; and  therefore  its
forces,  in the  greatest  and  least of  those  distances,  are  to its force  in  its
mean  distance   ;is 0.9830427  and  1,017522  to 1.  From  whence  we  have
 1,0175221, x  0,79863558.  to 0,9830427  X  0,8570327L  —  0,79863558
as 9 to 5 ; and  8  to L  as  1 to 4,4815.  Wherefore  since  the force  of  the

sun  is to the  force  of gravity  as 1 to 12868200,  the moon's  force  will be
 to the  force  of gravity  as  1 to 2871400.

   COR.  1. Since  the waters  excited  by  the  sun's  force  rise  to the height  of
a foot and  ll^V  inches,  the moon's  force  will  raise  the same  to the height
 of 8 feet and  7/¥  inches  ; and  the  joint  forces  of  botli  will  raise  the same
 to the height  of 10^  feet ; and  when  the moon  is in  its perigee  to  the
 height  of  12 i feet, and  more,  especially when  the wind  sets  the same  way
 as the tide.  And  a  force  of  that quantity  is abundantly  sufficient  to  ex
 cite all the  motions  of the  sea, and  agrees  well  with  the  proportion  of
 those  motions;  for in such  seas  as lie free and  open from  east  to  west,  as-
 iri the Pacific  sea. and  in those  tracts  of the  Atlantic  and  Ethiopia  seas
 which  lie without  the  tropics,  the waters commonly  rise  to 6, 9,* 12, cr  15
 feet ; but  in the Pacific  sea, which   is of a  greater  depth,  as  well   as- of  a
 larger  extent,  the tides  are  said  to be  greater  than  in the  Atlantic  andi
 Ethiopic  seas ; for to have  a full  tide  raised,  an  extent  of  sea from  east1  to
 west  is required  of no  less than  90  degrees.  In the Ethiopic  sea, the waters-
 rise to a less height  within  the  tropics  than  in the temperate  zones,  be
 cause  of  the narrowness  of the  sea between  Africa  and  the southern  parts
 of America.  In the middle  of  the open  sea  the waters  cannot  rise with*

out  falling  together, and  at  the same  time, upon  both  the  eastern  and  west
ern  shores, when,  notwithstanding,  in  our  narrow  seas, they ought  to  fall
on  those  shores  by alternate  turns  ; upon  which  account  there  is com
monly  but  a  small  flood  and  ebb  in such  islands  as lie far distant  from
the continent.  On  the  contrary,  in some  ports, where  to  fill and  empty
the bays  alternately  the  waters  are with  great  violence  forced  in and  out
through  shallow  channels,  the  flood and  ebb must  be greater  than  ordinary  ;
as at Plymouth  and  Chepstow  Bridge  in England,  at the mountains  of
St. Michael,  and  the town  of Auranches,  in Normandy,  and  at Combaia
and Pegu  in the East  Indies.  In  these  places  the  sea  is hurried  in and
qjit with  such  violence,  as sometimes  to lay the shores  under  water,  some
times  to leave them  dry for many  miles.  Nor  is this  force  of  the  influx
and  efflux  to be broke  till it has  raised  and  depressed  the waters  to 30, 40,
or 50  feet and above.  And  a like account  is to be given  of long and  shal
low channels  or  straits, such  as  the  Mugellrniic  straits, and  those  chan
nels which  environ England.  The  tide  in such  ports and  straits, by the
violence  of the  influx  and  efflux,  is augmented  above measure.  But  on
such  shores  as  lie towards  the  deep and  open  sea  with  a steep  descent,
where  the waters  may  freely  rise and  fall without  that  precipitation  of
influx  and  efflux, the  proportion  of  the  tides  agrees  with  the  forces  of  the
sun  and moon.

   COR.  2. Since  the moon's  force  to move  the sea  is to the force  of gravity
as 1 to 2871400,  it is evident  that  this  force  is far  less  than  to appear
sensibly  in statical  or hydrostatical  experiments,  or even  in those  of pen
dulums.   It is in the tides  only  that  this  force shews  itself by any  sensi
ble  effect.
   COR.  3. Because  the  force  of the moon   to move   the sea  is to the  like

force  of the sun  as 4,4815  to  1, and  those  forces  (by Cor.  14, Prop. LXVI,
Book  1) are as  the  densities  of  the bodies  of  the sun  and moon  and  the
cubes  of  their apparent  diameters  conjunctly,  the density  of the moon  will
be  to the density  of  the sun  as 4,4815  to 1 directly, and  the cube  of  the

moon's  diameter  to the cube  of  the  sun's diameter  inversely  ; that  is (see
ing the mean  apparent  diameters  of the  moon  and  sun  are  31' 161",  and
32'  12"),  as 4891  to 1000.  But  the  density  of the  sun  was  to the den
sity of the earth  as 1000  to 4000;  and  therefore  the density  of  the moon
is to the density  of  the earth  as 4891  to 4000,  or  as 11  to 9.  Therefore
the body  of the moon   is more  dense  and  more  earthly than  the  earth
itself.
   COR.  4. And  since  the  true diameter  of the moon  (from  the observations
of astronomers)  is to  the true  diameter  of the  earth  as 100  to  365,  the
mass  of matter  in the moon  will  be  to the mass  of matter  in the earth  as

of gravity  of the earth  and moon  as 40,783  to 39,788.
   COR.  7. And  the mean  distance  of the  centre  of the moon  from  the

centre  of the earth  will be  (in the moon's  octants)  nearly 60f  of the great

earth  was  1 9658600  Paris  feet, and  the mean  distance  of  the centres  of
the  earth  and  moon,  consisting  of 60| such  semi-diameters,  is equal  to
1187379440  feet.  And  this distance  (by the preceding  Cor.)  is to the  dis

tance  of the  moon's  centre  from  the common  centre  of gravity  of  the
earth  and moon  as 40.788  to 39,788  : which  latter  distance,  therefore,  is
1158268534  feet.  And  since  the moon,  in respect  of  the  fixed  stars, per
forms  its revolution  in 27d.  7h. 43f ', the versed  sine  of that  angle which
the moon  in  a minute  of  time  describes  is 12752341  to  the  radius
1000,000000,000000;  and  as  the  radius  is to  this versed  sine, so  are
1158268534   feet  to 147706353  feet.  The  moon,  therefore,  falling  tow
ards  the earth  by  that  force  which  retains  it  in its  orbit, would  in  one
minute  of time  describe 147706353   feet  ; and  if we augment   this  force
in the  proportion  of  17Sf £ to  l?7£-§,  we  shall have  the  total  force  of
gravity  at the  orbit  of the moon,  by Cor.  Prop.  Ill ; and  the moon  falling
by this  force, in one  minute  of time  would  describe  14.8538067  feet.  And

at the 60th  part  of the distance  of  the moon  from  the  earth's  centre,  that
is, at the distance  of 197896573   feet from  the centre  of  the  earth,  a body
falling by  its weight,  would,  in one  second  of  time,  likewise  describe
 14,8538067  feet.  And,  therefore,  at  the  distance  of  19615800,  which
compose  one  mean   serni -diameter  of the  earth, a heavy  body  would  de
 scribe  in falling  15,11175,  or 15  feet, 1 inch, and 4^   lines, in  the  same
time.  This  will  be the descent  of bodies  in the  latitude  of  45  degrees.
 And  by  the foregoing  table, to be found  under  Prop. XX,  the descent  in
 the latitude  of Paris  will  be a little greater by an  excess  of about  | parts
 of a line.  Therefore,  by this computation,  heavy  bodies  in the latitude  of
 Paris  falling  in vacno  will describe  15 Paris  feet, 1 inch, 4|f  lines, very
 nearly,  in one  second  of time.  And  if  the gravity  be diminished  by tak
 ing away  a quantity  equal  to the centrifugal  force  arising  in that  latitude

 ."rom  the earth's  diurnal  motion, heavy  bodies  falling  there  will  describe
 in one  second  of time  15  feet, 1 inch, and  l£ line. And  with  this velo

        PROPOSITION   XXXVIII.   PROBLEM   XIX.

                   To find  the figure  of  the moon's  body.
   If the moon's  body  were  fluid  like our  sea, the force  of the  earth  to raise
that  fluid  in the  nearest  and  remotest  parts would  be to the  force  of  the
moon  by which  our  sea  is raised  in  the  places  under  and  opposite  to the
moon  as the accelerative  gravity  of the moon  towards  the earth  to the  ac-
celerative  gravity  of  the earth  towards  the moon,  and  the diameter  of  the
moon  to the diameter  of the earth  conjunctly  ; that  is, as 39,788  to 1, and
100  to 365  conjunctly,  or  as 1081  to 100.  Wherefore,  since  our  sea, by
the  force  of the moon,  is raised  to Sf  feet, the lunar  fluid would  be raised
by the  force  of the  earth  to 93  feet ; and  upon  this account  the figure  of
the moon  would  be  a spheroid, whose  greatest  diameter  produced  would
pass through  the centre  of the  earth, and  exceed  the diameters  perpendicu
lar thereto  by 186  feet.  Such  a  figure,  therefore,  the moon   affects, and
must  have  put  on from  the beginning.  Q.E.I.
  COR.  Hence  it is that  the same  face  of  the moon  always  respects  the
earth  ; nor  can  the body  of  the moon  possibly  rest  in any  other  position,
but would  return  always  by a libratory  motion  to this situation ; but  those
librations, however,  must  be  exceedingly  slow, because  of  the weakness  of
the  forces which  excite them  ; so that  the  face of  the moon,  which  should
be always  obverted  to the earth, may,  for the reason  assigned  in Prop. XVI   I.
be turned  towards  the other  focus  of the  moon's  orbit, without  being im
mediately  drawn  back,  and  converted  again  towards  the  earth.

this force multiplied  by the distance CG  will  represent  the power  of  the
particle F  to turn  the  earth  round  its centre.  And,  therefore,  the power
of a particle  in the place F  will  be to the power  of  a  particle  in the place
A  as FG  X GO   to AH  X HC  ; that  is, as FC2   to AC2   : and  therefore

   And  because  the action  of those  particles  is exerted  in  the direction  of

X MC'T  wC^or 2XY  X  CY,  is to 2AH  X  HC,  the force  of  the  same
two  particles  situated  in A, as CX2   to AC2.  And  therefore  the  difference
of the  parts,  that  is, the  force  of the two  particles L  and  /, taken  together,
 to wheel  the earth  about,  is to  the  force  of two  particles, equal  to  the
former  and  situated  in the  place A, to turn  in like manner  the earth  round,
as LX2  —  CX2   to AC2.  But  if the circumference  IK  of  the  circle IK
is supposed  to be divided  into  an  infinite number  of  little equal  parts L,

all the LX2   will  be  to the  like number  of IX2  as 1 to 2 (by Lem.  1) ; and
to the same  number  of AC2  as IX2  to 2 AC2  ; and  the same  number   ol
CX2   to  as many  AC2  as 2CX2   to 2AC2.  Wherefore  the  united  forcet
of all the  particles  in the circumference  of the  circle IK  are  to the  joint

forces  of  as many  particles  in the place A  as IX2 —  2CX2   to 2AC2  ; and
therefore  (by Lem.  1) to the united  forces  of  as many  particles  in the  cir
cumference  of the  circle AE  as IX2  —  2CX2   to AC2.
  Now  if Pp.  the diameter  of  the  sphere,  is conceived  to be divided  into
an  infinite number  of equal  parts, upon  which  a like number  of  circles
IK  are supposed  to insist, the matter  in the circumference  of every  circle

£K  will  be as IX2  ; and  therefore  the  force  of that  matter  to turn  the
earth  about  will  be as IX2  into IX2 —  2CX2   : and  the  force  of the same
matter,  if it was  situated  in the circumference  of the  circle AE,  would  be  as

IX2  into AC2.  And  therefore  the  force  of  all the particles  of  the whole
matter  situated  without  the sphere  in the circumferences  of  all the  circle?
is to the  force  of  the  like number  of particles  situated  in the circumfer

ence  of the  greatest  circle AE   as  all  the IX2  into IX2 — 2CX2   to  as
many  IX2  into AC2  ; that  is, as  all the AC2  —  CX2   into AC2  —  3CX2
to  as many  AC2  —  CX2   into AC2  : that  is, as  all the AC4  —  4AC2  x

fluent  quantity,  whose  fluxion  is AC4  —  4AC2  X CX3  + 3CX4,  to  the
whole  fluent  quantity,  whose  fluxion  is AC4  —  AC2  X CX2   ; and, there
fore, by  the method  of  fluxions,  as AC4  X  CX  —  fAC2  X CX3  +

   The  middle  horary  motion  of the moon's  nodes  in  a circular  orbit, when
the  nodes  are  in  the  quadratures,  was  16"  35'"  16iv. 36V. ; the  half  of
which,  8"  17'"  38  v. 18V.  (for the reasons  above  explained)  is the mean  ho
rary motion  of  the nodes  in such  an  orbit, which  motion  in  a whole  side

real year becomes  20°  11' 46".  Because,  therefore,  the nodes  of the moon
in such  an  orbit would  be yearly  transferred  20°  11' 46"  in antecederttia  ;
and,  if there  were  more  moons,  the  motion  of the  nodes  of  every  one  (by

the annual  motion  of  the nodes  of  this moon  would  be  to 20°  31' 46"  as

did  not  mutually  touch  each  the  other,  or  whether  they  were  molten,  and

   Let  us, then, suppose  that  this  ring  is in  quantity  of matter  equal  to

motion  of  the  equinoctial  points  will  be diminished  in the same  propor
tion.  Wherefore  the annual  motion  of the equinoctial  points  of the body,

composed  of  both  ring and  sphere,  will  be to  the motion  20°  11' 46"   as
1436  to 39343  and  4590  to 489813  conjunctly,  that  is, as 100  to 292369.
But  the  forces by which  the nodes  of a number  of moons  (as we  explained
above), and  therefore  by which  the equinoctial  points  of  the ring  recede
(that  is, the forces  SIT,  in  fig. Prop. XXX),  are  in  the  several  particles
as the  distances  of those  particles from  the plane Q,R  ; and  by these  forces
the  particles  recede  from  that  plane  : and  therefore  (by Lem.  II) if the
matter  of the  ring was  spread  all over  the surface  of  the sphere,  after  the
fashion  of  the figure PupAPepl^,  in order  to make  up  that  exterior  part
of  the earth, the  total  force  or power  of  all the  particles  to wheel  about
the earth  round  any diameter  of  the equator, and  therefore  to move  the
equinoctial  points, would  become  less than  before  in the proportion  of 2  to

5.  Wherefore  the  annual  regress  of  the equinoxes  now  would  be  to 20°
11' 46"  as 10  to 73092  ; that  is. would  be 9"  56'"  50iv.
   But  because  the plane  of  the equator  is inclined  to that of  the  ecliptic,
this motion  is to be  diminished  in the  proportion  of the  sine  91706
(which  is the co-sine  of 23 1 deg.) to  the radius  100000  ; and  the remain
ing motion  will now  be 9"  7'"  20iv. which  is the annual  precession  of  the
equinoxes  arising from  the  force  of  the  sun.
   But  the  force  of  the moon  to move  the  sea was  to the  force  of  the sun

nearly  as 4,4815  to 1 ; and  the  force  of the moon   to move  the equinoxes
is to that  of the sun  in the same  proportion.  Whenoe  the annual  precession

of the  equinoxes  proceeding  from  the  force  of the moon  comes  out 40"
52"'  521V. and  the  total annual  precession  arising  from  the united  forces
of both  will be 50"  00"'  12iv. the  quantity  of which  motion  agrees  with
the phaenomena  ; for the  precession  of  the equinoxes,  by astronomical  ob

 servations,  is about  50"  yearly.
   If the  height  of the  earth  at the  equator  exceeds  its height  at  the
poles by more  than  17|  miles,  the matter  thereof  will  be more  rare  near
 the surface  than  at  the  centre  ; and  the precession  of  the equinoxes  will
 be augmented  by the  excess  of height,  and  diminished  by the greater  rarity,
  And  now  we  have  described  the  system  of the  sun,  the  earth, moon,
 and  planets,  it remains  that  we  add something  about  the comets.

 That  the comets  are higher  tliau  tJie moon,  and  in  the regions  of  the

                                   planets.
   As  the comets  were  placed by astronomers  above  the moon,  because  they
were found  to have  no diurnal  parallax,  so their  annual  parallax  is a con
vincing  proof  of their descending  into the  regions  of the  planets ; for  all
the comets  which  move  in a  direct  course  according  to  the  order  of  the
signs, about  the end  of their appearance  become  more  than  ordinarily  slow
or retrograde,  if the  earth  is between  them  and  the sun  ; and  more  than
ordinarily  swift, if the  earth  is approaching  to  a heliocentric  opposition
with  them  ; whereas,  on  the other  hand,  those which  move  against  the  or
der of  the signs, towards  the end  of  their  appearance  appear  swifter  than
they ought  to be, if the  earth  is between  them  and  the sun  ; and  slower,
and  perhaps  retrograde,  if the earth  is in the  other  side of  its orbit.  And
these  appearances  proceed  chiefly from  the  diverse  situations  which  the
earth  acquires  in the course  of its motion,  after  the same  manner  as it hap
pens  to the planets, which  appear  sometimes  retrograde,  sometimes  more
slowly, and sometimes  more  swiftly,  progressive,  according  as the motion  of
the earth  falls in with  that of the  planet,  or  is directed  the contrary  wav.
If the earth move  the same  way  with  the comet,  but, by an angular  motion
about  the sun,  so much  swifter  that  right  lines drawn  from  the earth  to
the comet  converge  towards  the  parts beyond  the  comet,  the  comet  seen
from  the earth, because  of  its slower  motion,  will appear  retrograde ; and
even  if the earth  is slower  than  the comet,  the motion  of the  earth  being
subducted,  the motion  of the comet  will at least appear  retarded  ; but  if the
earth  tends  the contrary  way  to that  of the  cornet, the motion  of the comet
will from  thence  appear  accelerated;  and from  this apparent  acceleration,
or retardation,  or regressive  motion,  the distance  of  the comet  may  be in-

longitude  of the comet  at  the  time  of  the  last observation.  The  angle,
therefore, FQG,  which  is the  difference  of the longitude,  proceeds  from  the
inequality  of  the motions  of  the comet  and  the earth ; and  this angle,  if
the  earth  and  cornet move  contrary  ways,  is added  to the angle TQ,G,  and
accelerates  the apparent  motion  of  the comet ; but  if the  comet  move  the
same  way  with  the  earth,  it is subtracted,  and  either  retards  the motion  ol
the comet,  or perhaps  renders  it retrograde,  as we  have  but now  explained.
This  angle,  therefore,  proceeding  chiefly from  the motion  of the  earth,  is
justly  to be esteemed  the  parallax  of  the comet;  neglecting,  to wit, some
little increment  or decrement  that may  arise from  the unequal  motion  of
the comet  in its orbit  : and  from  this parallax  we  thus deduce  the distance
of the comet.  Let  S represent  the  sun, acT  v

the orbis tnagnus,  a the  earth's  place  in the
first observatiun,  c the place of  the  earth  in
the  third  observation, T  the  place  of  the
earth  in the  last observation,  and TT   a right
line drawn  to the beginning  of Aries.  Set
off the angle TTV  equal  to the angle TQF,
that  is, equal  to the  longitude  of  the comet
at the  time when  the  earth  is in T ; join  ac,

and  produce  it to  g1, so  as ag  may  be  to ac
 as AG   to AC  ; and  g  will  be  the  place  at
which  the  earth would  have  arrived  in  the
time  of the  last observation,  if it had  con
tinued  to move  uniformly  in the  right  line

ac.  Wherefore,  if we draw  g'T  parallel  to TT,  and make  the  angle T^V
equal  to the angle TQ,G,  this angle Tg\  will  be equal  to the longitude  of
 the comet  seen from  the place  g, and  the  angle TVg-  will  be the parallax
which  arises from  the earth's  being  transferred  from  the place g into  the
 place T ; and  therefore  V  will  be the place  of the comet  in the plane  of the
 ecliptic.  And  this place V  is commonly  lower  than  the  orb  of  Jupiter.
   The  same  thing may  be deduced  from  the incurvation  of the way  of the
 comets  ; for  these  bodies  move  almost  in great  circles, while  their  velocity
 is great ; but  about  the end  of  their  course, when  that  part  of  their appa
 rent motion  which  arises from  the  parallax  bears  a greater  proportion  to
 their whole  apparent  motion,  they commonly  deviate  from  those  circles, and
 when  the  earth  goes  to one  side, they deviate  to the  other  : and  this  deflex
 ion, because  of  its corresponding  with  the motion  of  the  earth, must  arise
 chiefly from  the parallax  ; and  the quantity  thereof  is so considerable,  as,
 by my  computation,  to place  the  disappearing  comets  a good  deal  lower
 than Jupiter.  Whence   it follows  that when  they approach  nearer  to us in
 their  perigees  and  perihelions  they  often  descend  below  the  orbs  of Mare
 and  the  inferior  planets.

 the distance;  to wit, in one duplicate  proportion,  on  account  of the increase
 of the distance  from  the sun, and  in another  duplicate  proportion,  on  ac
 count  of the decrease  of the apparent  diameter.  Wherefore  if both  the
quantity  of light and  the apparent  diameter  of  a comet  are given,  its dis
 tance  will be also given, by taking  the distance  of the comet  to the distance
of  ;i planet  in the direct proportion  of  their diameters  and  the reciprocal
subduplicate  proportion  of their  lights.  Thus,  in  the  comet  of  the year
 1682, Mr. Flamsted  observed  with  a telescope  of 16  feet, and  measured
with  a micrometer,  the  least diameter  of  its head;  2' 00;  but  the nucleus
 or star in the middle  of the head  scarcely amounted   to the  tenth  part  of
 this measure;  and  therefore  its diameter  was  only  11"  or 12"  • but  in the
light and splendor  of  its head  it surpassed  that  of  the comet  in the year
 1680; and might  be compared  with  the  stars  of  the  lirst or second magni
tude.  Let  us suppose  that Saturn  with  its ring was  about  four times  more
lucid ; and  because  the light of  the  ring was  almost  equal  to the light  of
the globe  within,  and  the apparent  diameter  of the globe  is about  21", and
therefore  the united  light of both  globe  and  ring would  be  equal  to the
light of  a globe whose  diameter  is 30",  it follows  that  the distance  of th
comet  was  to the distance  of Saturn  as 1 to  v/4 inversely, and  12"  to 30
directly ; that  is, as 24  to 30, or 4 to 5.  Again ; the comet  in the month
of April  1665,  as Hevelius  informs  us, excelled  almost  all the  fixed  stars
in splendor,  and  even  Saturn  itself, as being  of a much  more  vivid  colour  ;
for this comet  was  more  lucid than  that  other  which  had  appeared  about
the end  of  the preceding  year, and  had  been compared  to the  stars of  the

h'rst magnitude.  The  diameter  of its head  was  about  6' ; but  the nucleus,
compared  with  the planets  by means  of a  telescope, was  plainly  less than
Jupiter ; and sometimes  judged  less, sometimes  judged  equal,  to the globe
of Saturn  within  the ring.  Since,  then, the diameters  of the heads  of  the
comets  seldom  exceed  8' or 12;, and  the diameter  of the nucleus  or central
star  is but about  a tenth  or perhaps  fifteenth  part  of  the diameter  of  the
head,  it appears  that  these  stars  are generally  of about  the same  apparent
magnitude  with  the planets.  But  in regard  that  their  light may  be often
compared  with  the light  of Saturn,  yea, and sometimes  exceeds  it, it is evi
dent  that  all comets  in their  perihelions  must  either  be placed  below  or not
far above  Saturn  ; and  they are much  mistaken  who  remove  them  almost
as far  as the  fixed  stars ; for  if it was  so, the comets  could  receive  no more
light from  our  sun  than  our  planets  do from  the  fixed  stars.
   So  far we  have  gone,  without  considering  the  obscuration  which  comets
suffer from  that  plenty  of  thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads,
and  through  which  the heads  always  shew  dull, as through   i cloud;  for by

| The near | approach of | the comets | is farther | confirmed from th | e light of |
| tb.eir heads; | for the light | of a celes | tial body, | illuminated by the | sun, and |
| receding to r | emote parts, | is diminis | hed in the | quadruplicate prop | ortion of |
| the distance; | to wit, in on | e duplicate | proportion, | on account of th | e increase |

| 1680; and mig | ht be compa | red with | the stars of | the lirst or secon | d magni |
| tude. Let us | suppose that | Saturn w | ith its ring | was about four ti | mes more |
| lucid ; and be | cause the lig | ht of the | ring was | almost equal to th | e light of |
| the globe with | in, and the | apparent | diameter of | the globe is about | 21", and |
| therefore the | united light | of both g | lobe and r | ing would be equ | al to the |
| light of a glo | be whose di | ameter is | 30", it follo | ws that the distan | ce of th |
| comet was to | the distance | of Saturn | as 1 to v | /4 inversely, and | 12" to 30 |
| directly ; that | is, as 24 to | 30, or 4 t | o 5. Again | ; the comet in t | he month |
| of April 1665 | , as Hevelius | informs | us, excelled | almost all the f | ixed stars |
| in splendor, a | nd even Satu | rn itself, | as being of | a much more vivi | d colour ; |
| for this comet | was more l | ucid than | that other | which had appear | ed about |
| the end of th | e preceding y | ear, and | had been c | ompared to the sta | rs of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| compared with | the planets | by means | of a teles | cope, was plainly | less than |
| Jupiter ; and | sometimes j | udged less, | sometimes | judged equal, to | the globe |
| of Saturn wit | hin the ring | . Since, t | hen, the di | ameters of the head | s of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comets seldom | exceed 8' or | 12;, and | the diamete | r of the nucleus o | r central |

how  much  the more  a body  is obscured  by this smoke,  by so much  the more
near  it must  be allowed  to come  to the  sun,  that  it may  vie with  the plan-
eta in the quantity  of  light which   it reflects.  Whence   it is probable  that
the comets  descend  far below  the  orb of Saturn,  as we  proved  before  frou
their parallax.  But, above  all, the thing  is evinced  from  their  tails, which

must  be owing  either  to the sun's  light  reflected  by  a smoke  arising from
them,  and  dispersing  itself through  the  aether,  or  to the light of  their own
heads.  In  the former  case, we  must  shorten  the  distance  of  the  comets,
lest we  be obliged  to  allow  that  the smoke  arising  from  their  heads  is
propagated  through  such  a vast  extent  of  space,  and  with  such  a velocity
and  expansion  as  will seem  altogether  incredible ; in  the  latter  case,  the
whole  light of both  head  arid tail  is to be ascribed  to the central  nucleus.
But.  then,  if we  suppose  all this  light  to be united  and  condensed  within
the disk  of  the  nucleus,  certainly  the  nucleus  will  by far exceed  Jupiter
itself  in splendor,  especially when  it emits  a very large and  lucid tail   If.
therefore,  under  a less apparent  diameter,  it reflects more  light,  it must  be
much  more  illuminated  by the  sun, and  therefore much  nearer  to it; and
the same  argument  will bring down  the heads  of comets  sometimes  within

the  orb  of Venus,  viz., when,  being  hid under  the  sun's  rays, they emit  such
huge  and  splendid  tails, like beams  of  fire, as sometimes  they  do ; for  if all
that  light was  supposed  to be gathered  together  into  one  star,  it would
sometimes  exceed  not  one Venus  only, but  a  great many  such  united
into  one.

   Lastly ; the same  thing  is inferred  from  the  light of  the heads, which
increases  in the  recess  of  the  cornets from  the  earth  towards  the  sun,  and
decreases  in their  return  from  the sun  towards  the earth  ; for  so the comet
of  the year 1665  (by the observations  of Hevelius],  from  the time  that  it
was  first seen,  was  always  losing  of its apparent  motion,  and  therefore  had
already  passed  its perigee  ; but  yet the splendor  of  its head  was  daily  in

creasing,  till, being  hid under  the  sun's  rays, the  comet  ceased  to appear.
The  comet  of  the year 1683  (by the  observations  of the same  LJevelius),
about  the end  of July, when  it  first appeared, moved   at  a very  slow  rate,
advancing  only about  40  or 45 minutes  in  its orb  in  a day's  time ; but
from  that time  its diurnal  motion  was  continually  upon  the  increase,  till
September  4, when  it arose  to about  5 degrees  ; and  therefore,  in  all  this
interval  of time,  the comet  was  approaching  to the earth.  Which   is like
wise proved  from  the  diameter  of  its head, measured  with  a micrometer  ;
for, August  6, Hevelius  found  it only  6' 05", including  the coma,  which,
September  2  he observed  to be  9' 07", and  therefore  its head  appeared  far
less  about, the  beginning  than  towards  the  end  of the  motion  ; though
about  the beginning,  because  nearer  to  the  sun,  it appeared  far more  lucid
than  towards  the  end, as  the same  Hevelius  declares.  Wherefore  in  all
this interval  of time,  on  account  of  its  recess from  the  sun,  it decreases

| them, and | dispe | rsing itself t | hrough the aet | her, or to t | he light of | their own |

| the disk of | the | nucleus, cer | tainly the nu | cleus will | by far excee | d Jupiter |
| itself in sp | lendo | r, especially | when it emits | a very larg | e and lucid | tail If. |
| therefore, | under | a less appare | nt diameter, | it reflects m | ore light, | it must be |

in splendor, notwithstanding  its access  towards  the earth.  The  comet  of
the year  1618,  about  the middle  of December,  and  that  of  the year  1680,
about  the end  of the same  month,  did both move  with  their greatest  velo
city, and  were  therefore  then  in their  perigees  : but  the greatest  splendor
of  their heads  was  seen  two  weeks  before, when  they had  just got clear  of
the sun's  rays  ; and  the greatest  splendor  of  their  tails a little more  early,
when  yet nearer  to the sun.  The  head  of the  former  comet  (according  to
the observations  of Cysdtus],  Dece/itber  1, appeared  greater  than  the  stars
of ^ the  first magnitude:  and, December  16 (then  in  the  perigee),  it was
but  little diminished  in magnitude,  but  in the  splendor  and  brightness  of
its light  a  great  deal.  January  7, Kepler, being  uncertain  about  the
head,  left oif observing.  December  12, the  head  of the  latter comet  was
seen  and  observed  by Mr. Flamsted,  when  but  9 degrees  distant  from  the
sun  ; which  is scarcely  to be done  in a star  of the  third magnitude.  De
cember  15 and  17, it appeared  as  a star of the  third magnitude,  its lustre
being  diminished  by the  brightness  of the  clouds  near  the setting  sun.
December  26, when  it moved  with  the  greatest  velocity,  being almost  in
its perigee,  it was  less than  the mouth  of Pegasus,   a star of  the  third
magnitude.  January  3, it appeared  as  a star  of the fourth.  January  9,
as one  of the  fifth. January  13, it was  hid by the splendor  of the moon,
then  in her  increase.  January  25, it was  scarcely equal  to the  stars  of
the  seventh magnitude.  If we  compare  equal  intervals  of time  on  one
side and  on  the other  from  the perigee,  we  shall  find  that  the head  of  the
comet,  which  at both  intervals  of time  was  far, but  yet equally, removed
from  the  earth, and  should  have  therefore  shone  with  equal  splendor,  ap
peared  brightest  on  the side  of the perigee  towards  the  sun,  and  disap
peared  on  the other.  Therefore,  from  the  great  difference  of light in the
one  situation  and  in the  other, we  conclude  the  great  vicinity  of  the sun
and  comet  in the  former ; for the  light of comets  uses  to be regular,  and
to appear  greatest when  the heads move  fastest, and  are  therefore  in their
perigees ; excepting  in  so far  as it is increased  by their  nearness  to the
sun.       -

   COR.  2. From  what  has been  said, we may  likewise  understand  why
comets  are  so frequently  seen  in that hemisphere  in which  the sun  is, and
so seldom  in  the  other.  If they were  visible  in  the  regions  far  above
Saturn,  they would  appear  more  frequently  in  the parts  opposite  to  the
sun ; for such  as were  in those  parts would  be nearer  to the  earth, whereas
the presence  of the  sun  must  obscure  and  hide  those  that appear  in  the
hemisphere  in which  he  is.  Yet, looking  over  the  history  of comets,  I
find  that  four  or five times  more  have  been  seen  in the hemisphere  towards
the sun  than  in the  opposite  hemisphere  ; besides, without  doubt,  not  a
few, which  have  been  hid  by the light  of  the  sun  : for comets  descending

into our  parts  neither  emit  tails, nor  are  so  well  illuminated  by the  sun,
as  to discover  themselves  to our  naked  eyes, until  they  are come  nearer  to
us than Jupiter.  But  the  far greater  part of that  spherical  space, which
is described  about  the  sun  with  so small  an  interval,  lies on  that  side  of
the earth  which  regards  the  sun  ; and  the comets  in that  greater  part  are
commonly  more  strongly  illuminated,  as being  for the most  part  nearer  to
the  sun.
   COR.  3. Hence  also  it  is evident  that  the  celestial  spaces  are void  of
resistance  ; for though  the comets  are  carried  in oblique  paths, and  some
times  contrary  to the  course  of  the  planets, yet they move  every  way  with
the  greatest  freedom,  and  preserve  their  motions  for  an  exceeding  long
time, even  where  contrary  to the  course  of  the planets.  I am  out  in my
judgment  if they  are  not  a  sort  of planets  revolving  in  orbits returning
into  themselves  with  a  perpetual  motion  ; for, as  to what  some  writers
contend,  that they  are  no  other  than  meteors,  led into  this opinion  by the
perpetual  changes  that happen  to their  heads,  it seems  to have  no founda
tion ; for the  heads  of comets  are  encompassed  with  huge  atmospheres,
and  the lowermost  parts  of these  atmospheres  must  be  the  densest  ; and
therefore  it is in  the clouds  only, not  in  the bodies  of  the comets  them
selves, that  these changes  are seen.  Thus  the  earth,  if it was  viewed  from
the  planets, would,  without  all doubt,  shine  by the light of  its clouds, and
the  solid body  would  scarcely  appear  through  the surrounding  clouds.
Thus  also  the  belts  of Jupiter  are formed  in  the clouds  of  tha«t planet,
for they change  their position  one  to another,  and  the  solid body  of Jupiter
is hardly  to be seen  through  them  ; and  much  more  must  the bodies  of
comets  be hid  under  their atmospheres,  which  are both  deeper  and  thicker.

          PROPOSITION   XL.   THEOREM    XX.

 That  the comets  mnve  in  some  of the  conic  sections, having  their foci
   in the  centre  of the  sun  ; and  by  radii drawn   to  the sun  describe
   areas  proportional  to the times.
   This  proposition  appears  from  Cor.  1, Prop.  XIII, Book   1, compared
•vith Prop.  VIII, XII,  and  XIII, Book  HI.
   COR.  1. Hence  if comets  are revolved  in  orbits  returning  into  them
selves, those  orbits  will  be  ellipses ; and  their  periodic  times  be  to the
periodic  times  of  the planets  in the sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  prin
cipal axes.  And  therefore  the  comets,  which  for  the most  part  of  their
course  are higher  than  the  planets, and  upon  that  account  describe  orbits
with  greater  axes,  will  require  a longer  time  to  finish  their  revolutions.
Thus  if the  axis  of  a comet's  orbit  was  four  times  greater  than  the  axis
 of the  orbit  of Saturn,  the time  of the  revolution  of  the comet  would  be
 to the  time  of the  revolution  of Saturn,  that  is, to 30  years,  as 4  ^/ 4
 (or 8) to 1, and would  therefore  be 240  years.

| the greatest | freedom, | and preserve | their moti | ons | for an exc | eeding long |
| time, even wh | ere contr | ary to the | course of th | e | planets. I a | m out in my |

| contend, that | they are | no other th | an meteors, | led | into this op | inion by the |
| perpetual cha | nges that | happen to t | heir heads, i | t s | eems to have | no founda |
| tion ; f or the | heads o | f comets are | encompass | ed | with huge | atmospheres, |

| therefore it | is in the | clouds only, | not in the | bo | dies of the c | omets them |

| the solid bo | dy would | scarcely ap | pear throug | h | the surroun | ding clouds. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Thus also t | he belts o | f Jupiter ar | e formed i | n t | he clouds of | tha«t planet, |
| for they chan | ge their p | osition one t | o another, an | d | the solid bod | y of Jupiter |

 may  be used  for them  without  sensible  error.
   COR.  3. And,  therefore, by Cor.  7, Prop. XVI, Book  1, the velocity  of
 every  comet  will always  be  to the  velocity  of any  planet, supposed  to be
 revolved  at the same  distance  in  a circle  about  the sun, nearly  in the sub-
 duplicate  proportion  of double  the distance  of  the planet from  the centre
 of the sun  to the distance  of  the comet  from  the  sun's  centre, very  nearly.
 Let  us suppose  the radius  of the  or bis wag  mis,  or  the  greatest  semi-
diameter  of the  ellipsis which  the earth  describes,  to consist  of 100000000
 parts ; and  then  the  earth  by  its mean  diurnal  motion  will  describe
 1720212  of those  parts, and  716751  by  its horary motion.  And  there
fore the comet,  at the same  mean  distance  of  the earth  from  the sun, with
a velocity which  is to the velocity  of  the earth  as  v/ 2 to I, would  by  its
diurnal  motion  describe 2432747  parts, and  101.3641  parts by  its horary
motion.  But  at  greater  or  less distances  both  the  diurnal  and  horary
motion  will be to this diurnal  and  horary  motion  in the reciprocal  subdu-
plicate proportion  of  the  distances,  and  is therefore  given.
   COR.  4. Wherefore  if the  lattis rectum  of  the parabola  is quadruple  of
the radius  of the  orbis maginis,  and  the  square  of that  radius  is sup
posed  to consist  of 100000000  parts, the  area  which  the comet  will daily
describe  by a  radius  drawn  to  the  sun  will  be 12163731   parts, and  the
horary  area  will  be 506821  parts.  But,  if the  latus  rectum   is greater
or  less in any  proportion,  the  diurnal  and  horary  area  will  be  less  or
greater  in the subduplicate  of  the same  proportion  reciprocally.

   If the  differences  of the observed  longitudes  are  small, suppose  of 4 or 5

Prom  three observations  given  to determine  the  orbit of  a comet  moving
                                    in  a parabola.
   This  being  a Problem  of very  great  difficulty,  I tried many  methods  of
resolving  it ; and  several  of  these Problems,  the  composition  whereof  I
have  triven in  the  first Book,  tended  to this purpose.  But  afterwards  I
contrived  the  following  solution,  which  is something  more  simple.
   •Select  three  observations  distant  one  from  another  by intervals  of time
nearly  equal ; but  let that  interval  of time  in which  the  comet  moves
more  slowly  be somewhat  greater  than  the  other  ; so, to wit, that  the  dif
ference  of the  times  may  be to  the sum  of the  times  as the sum  of  the





t imes  to about 600  days ; or  that  the  point E  may  fall upon  M  nearly,
and may  err therefrom  rather  towards  1 than  towards A.   If such  direct
observations  are  not  at hand,  a new  place of  the comet  must  be found, by
Lem.  VI.                                   A-

   Let  S represent  the  sun  ; T,  t, r} three  places  of  the  earth  in the  orbis

mag-mis;  TA,  /B, rC, three  observed  longitudes  of the comet;  V  the
time between  the  first observation  and  the second  ; W  the  time  between
the second  and  the  third ; X  the length  which  in the whole  time V + W





the comet  might  describe  with  that  velocity which  it hath  in  the mean
distance  of  the earth  from  the  sun, which  length  is to be  found  by Cor.  3,

                      THE  MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES   [BOOK  III.

Prop. XL,  Book  III ; and  tV  a perpendicular  upon  the chord TT.   In  the
mean  observed  longitude  tfB take  at  pleasure  the point  B, for the place  of
the comet  in the plane  of the  ecliptic ; and  from  thence, towards  the  sun
S, draw  the  line BE,  which  may  be  to the perpendicular  /V  as the content
under SB  and  St2  to the cube  of  the hypothenuse  of the right angled  tri
angle, whose  sides  are SB,  and  the tangent  of  the latitude  of the comet  in
the second  observation  to  the  radius  ^B.  And  through  the point E  (by
Lemma  VII) draw  the right  line AEC,  whose  parts AE  and  EC,  terminat
ing in the right  lines TA  and  rC. may  be one  to the  other  as the times V
and  \V  : then A  and C  will  be nearly  the places  of  the comet  in the plane
of  the  ecliptic in  the  first and  third  observations,  if B  was  its place
rightly assumed  in the second.
  Upon  AC,  bisected  in I, erect  the  perpendicular  li. Through  B draw
the obscure  line Ei  parallel  to AC.   Join  the obscure  line  Si, cutting AC
in A, and complete  the  parallelogram  il AJU. Take  \o equal  to 3IA  ; and
through  the sun  S draw  the obscure  line<0£  equal  to 3So  -f 3 fa.  Then,
cancelling  the  letters A, E, C, I, from  the  point B  towards  the  point  £,
draw  the new  obscure  line BE,  which  may  be  to the  former BE  in  the
duplicate  proportion  of the distance BS  to the quantity  Sju +  1 fa.  And
through  the point E  draw  again  the right  line AEC  by the same  rule  as
before ; that  is, so  as its parts AE  and EC  may  be one  to the  other  as the
times  V  and W  between  the  observations.  Thus  A and  C  will  be  the
places of  the comet  more  accurately.
  Upon  AC,  bisected  in I, erect  the perpendiculars  AM,  CN,  IO,  of which
AM  and CN  may  be the tangents  of the latitudes  in the  first and  third  ob
servations,  to the  radii TA  and TC.  Join MN,  cutting  IO  in O.  Draw  the
rectangular  parallelogram   zlAjt/, as before.  In I A produced  take ID  equal  to
Sfi +  f fa.  Then  in MN,  towards  N,  take  MP,  which  may  be  to  the
above  found  length X  in the subduplicate  proportion  of the mean  distance
 of the  earth  from  the sun  (or of  the semi-diameter  of  the  orbis  'tnagnus]
 to the distance OD.   If  the point P  fall upon  the point N;  A, B, and  C,
 <vill be three  places  of the comet,  through  which  its orbit  is to be described
 in the plane  of  the ecliptic.  But  if the  point P  falls not  upon  the point
 N, in the right  line AC  take CG  equal  to NP,  so  as the points G  and P
 may  lie on  the same  side of  the  line NC.
   By  the same  method  as  the  points  E, A, C, G, were  found  from  the  as
 sumed  point  B, from  other  points  6 and  j3 assumed  at pleasure,  find out  the

 new  points  e, a,  c, g ; and  e, a, «, y.  Then  through  G,  g-, and  y, draw  the
 circumference  of a circle G^y,  cutting  the right  line rC  in Z  : and  Z  will
 be one  place  of the comet  in the plane  of the ecliptic. And  in AC,  ac,  OK,
 making AF,  a/,  a</>, equal  respectively  to CG,  eg, KJ ; through  the points P,
 f, and  0, draw  the circumference  of  a circle  Vf<t>, cutting  the right  line AT
 in X  ; and  the point X  will  be another  place of  the comet  in the plane  of

| draw the new obsc | ure line | BE, which may | be to | the form | er BE | in the |

the ecliptic. And  at  the  points X  and  Z, erecting  the tangents  of  the
latitudes  of the comet  to the  radii TX  and  rZ, two  places of the comet  in
its own  orbit  will  be determined.  Lastly,  if (by Prop. XIX.,  Book  1) to
the focus  S  a parabola  is described  passing  through  those  two  places,  this
parabola  will  be the  orbit  of the comet.  Q.E.L
  The  demonstration  of this construction  follows  from  the preceding Lem
mas,  because  the right  line AC   is cut  in E  in the proportion  of  the  times,
by Lem.  VI L, as  it ought  to be, by Lem.  VIII. ; and BE,  by Lem.  XL,  is a
portion  of the right  line BS  or B£  in the plane  of  the  ecliptic, intercepted
between  the  arc ABC  and  the chord AEC  ; and MP  (by Cor. Lem.  X.)  is
the length  of the chord  of  that  arc, which  the comet  should  describe  in  its

proper  orbit between  the  firs': and  third  observation,  and  therefore  is equal
to MN,  providing  B  is a  true  place of  the comet  in  the  plane  of  the
ecliptic.
   But  it will  be convenient  to assume  the  points B, b, (3, not  at random,
but nearly true.  If the angle AQ/,  at which  the projection  of the orbit  in
the plane  of the  ecliptic  cuts  the  right  line £B,  is rudely known,  at that
angle  with  Bt  draw  the obscure  line AC,  which  may  be  to  -fTT  in the sub-
duplicate  proportion  of SQ,  to S/ ; and, drawing  the right  line SEB   so  as
its part EB  may  be equal  to the length  \t, the point  B  will  be determined,
which  we  are  to use  for  the  first time.  Then,  cancelling  the  right  line
AC,  and drawing  anew AC  according  to  the  preceding  construction,  and,
aioreover,  finding  the length MP,  in tB  take  the point  b, by this  rule, that,
if TA  and rC  intersect  each  other  in Y, the  distance  Y6  may  be  to the
distance YB  in  a proportion  compounded  of the proportion  of MP   to MN,
and  the subduplicate  proportion  of SB  to Sb.  And  by the same  method
you may  find  the  third  point  18, if you  please  to  repeat  the operation  the
third  time ; but  if this method   is followed,  two  operations  generally  will be
sufficient ; for  if the distance  Bb happens  to be very  small,  after  the points

F,/,  and  G,  §•, are found, draw  the right  lines F/and  G^-, and  they  will
cut TA  and  rC  in the points  required, X  and  Z.


                               EXAMPLE.

   Let  the comet  of the year 1680  be proposed.  The  following  table shews
the motion  thereof,  as observed  by Flamsted,  and  calculated  afterwards  by
him  from  his observations,  and  corrected  by Dr. Halley  from  the same  ob
servations.

| parabola w | ill | be the orbit of | the comet. | Q.E.L |  |  |
| The dem | onst | ration of this | construction | follows from | the prec | eding Lem |
| mas, becau | se t | he right line A | C is cut in | E in the propo | rtion of | the times, |
| by Lem. V | I L, | as it ought to | be, by Lem. | VIII. ; and BE, | by Lem | . XL, is a |
| portion of | the | right line BS | or B£ in th | e plane of the | ecliptic, | intercepted |
| between t | he ar | c ABC and th | e chord AE | C ; and MP ( | by Cor. | Lem. X.) is |
| the length | of | the chord of th | at arc, whic | h the comet sh | ould des | cribe in its |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| proper orb | it b | etween the firs' | : and third | observation, an | d theref | ore is equal |

| to MN, p | rovi | ding B is a t | rue place o | f the comet i | n the p | lane of the |
| ecliptic. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| But it | will | be convenient | to assume | the points B, | b, ( 3, n ot | at random, |
| but nearly | tru | e. If the angl | e AQ/, at w | hich the projec | tion of | the orbit in |
| the plane | of t | he ecliptic cut | s the right | line £B, is rud | ely kno | wn, at that |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| angle with | Bt | draw the obscu | re line AC, | which may be | to -fT T | in the sub- |
| duplicate | prop | ortion of SQ, | to S/ ; and, | drawing the ri | ght line | SEB so as |
| its part E | B m | ay be equal to | the length | \t, the point B | will be | determined, |
| which we | are | to use for the | first time | . Then, cancel | ling th | e right line |
| AC, and d | rawi | ng anew AC | according t | o the preceding | constru | ction, and, |
| aioreover, | find | ing the length | MP, in tB | take the point | b, b y thi | s rule, that, |

   These  observations  were  made  by a telescope  of 7 feet, with  a microme
ter and  threads  placed  in the  focus  of the telescope;  by Avhich  instruments
we determined  the positions  both  of  the  fixed  stars among  themselves,  and
of the comet  in respect  of the  fixed stars.  Let  A  represent  the  star  of the

fourth  magnitude  in the  left heel of Perseus  (Bayer's  o), B  the following
star of the  third magnitude  in  the  left foot (Bayer's  s), C  a star of  the
sixth magnitude  (Bayer's  11} in the  heel  of the same  foot, and  1). E, F, G,
H,  I, K.  L, M, N, O, Z,  a, j3, y, S, other  smaller  stars  in  the same  foot;
and  let p, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, represent  the places  of the comet  in  the
observations  above  set down   ; and, reckoning  the distance AB  of 80 r\ parts,

4^6           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III.

   The  positions  of the comet  to  these  fixed  stars were  observed  to be  as
follow  :

   Friday,  February  25, O.S.  at 8ih.  P. M.  the distance  of  the comet  in p
from  the star E  wai  less than  T\ AE,  and  greater  than  }AE,  and  therefore
nearly  equal  to T3SAE;  and  the angle AjoE  was  a little obtuse,  but almost
right.  For  from  A, letting  fall  a perpendicular  on pE,  the  distance  of the
comet  from  that perpendicular  was  j/»E.
   The  same  night,  at 9|h., the distance  of the comet  in P from  the  star E

was  greater  than —  AE,  and  less than —  AE,  and  therefore  nearly  equal


to j^- of AE,  or  /^ AE.    But  the  distance  of the  comet  from  the perpen-
    ^8"
dicular  let fall from  the  star A  upon  the  right  line PE  was  jPE.
   Sunday,  February  27, 8|h. P. M.  the distance  of  the comet  in Q, from
the star O  was  equal  to the distance  of  the  stars O  and  H  • and  the  risjht
line QO  produced  passed  between  the  stars K  and B.  I could  not, by
reason  of intervening  clouds, determine  the position  of  the  star  to greater
accuracy.

   Tuesday,  March  1, ] lh. P. M.  the comet  in R  lay exactly  in a line be
tween  the  stars K  and  C, so  as the  part CR  of  the right  line CRK   was  a
little greater  than £CK,  and  a little  less than JCK  +  jCR,  and  therefore
=  iCK  + A  CR,  or  if CK.

equal  to ^ of yd, or a little  less, as perhaps  T5g of yd ; and  a perpendicular
 let fall from  the  star  6 on  the right  line yY  was  equal  to about  £ or | yd.
But  the comet  being  then  extremely  near  the horizon,  was  scarcely  discern
ible, and  therefore  its place could  not  be determined  with  that  certainty  as
in the foregoing  observations.
  Prom  these  observations,  by constructions  of figures  and  calculations,  I
deduced  the longitudes  and  latitudes  of the  comet  ; and  Mr. Pound,  by
correcting  the  places  of the  fixed  stars, hath  determined  more  correctly  the
places  of the comet,  which  correct  places  are  set down  above.  Though  my
micrometer  was  none  of the  best, yet  the  errors  in longitude  and  latitude
(as derived  from  my  observations)  scarcely  exceed  one minute.  The  comet

sensibly  towards  the north, from  the  parallel which  it described  about  the
end  of February.
   Now,  in order  to determine  the orbit  of the comet  out  of the observations
above  described,  I selected  those  three which  Flamsted  made,  Dec.  21, Jan.
5, and  Jan. 25;  from  which  I found  S^  of 9842,1  parts, and  V£  of 455
such  as the semi-diameter  of the  or bis magnus  contains 10000.  Then  for
the  first observation,  assuming  tE  cf 5657  of those  parts,  1 found  SB  9747,
BE  for the  first time  412,  Sji 9503, U  413, BE  for  the  second  time  421,
OD  10186, X  8528,4, PM  8450, MN   8475, NP  25;  from  whence,  by the
second  operation.  I collected  the distance  tb 5640  ; and  by this operation  1
at last deduced  the distances TX  4775  and  rZ  11322.  From  which,  lim
iting the  orbit, I found  its descending  node  in  25, and  ascending  node  in  V?
1 ° 53' ; the inclination  of  its plane  to the  plane  of  the  ecliptic 61° 20^    ,
the vertex  thereof  (or the  perihelion  of  the  comet)  distant  from  the node

8° 38', and  in t  27°  43', with  latitude  7°  34'  south;  its lotus  return
236.8;  and  the diurnal  area  described  by a radius  drawn  to the sun  93585,
supposing  the square  of the semi-diameter  of the orbis magnus  lOUOOOOOO  ;
that  the comet  in  this  orbit moved  directly according  to the order  of  the

signs, and  on DM.   8(1. OO1'. 04'  P. M  was  in the vertex  or perihelion  of its
orbit.  All which  I determined  by  scale  and  compass,  and  the chords  of
angles, taken  from  the  table  of natural  sines, in  a  pretty  large  figure, in
which,  to wit, the radius  of  the  orbis magnus  (consisting  of 10000  parts)
was  equal  to 16^  inches  of an English  foot.
   Lastly,  in order  to  discover  whether  the  comet  did  truly move  in  the
orbit  so determined,  I investigated  its places  in this  orbit  partly by arith
metical  operations,  and  partly by scale  and  compass,  to the times  of gome
of the observations,  as may  be seen  in the following  table  :—

| But the comet | being then | extreme | ly n | ear the ho | rizon, was sca | rcely discern |

| Prom these | observations, | by co | nstru | ctions of | figures and c | alculations, I |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

   But  afterwards  Dr. Halley  did  determine  the  orbit  to  a greater  accu
racy by an  arithmetical  calculus  than  could  be done  by linear  descriptions  :
and, retaining  the  place of  the nodes  in s  and ^  1° 53', and  the  inclina

of  the comet's  being  in perihelio,  Dec.  8(i. OUh.  04', he found  the  distance                                        + 2*"of  the perihelion  from  the ascending  node  measured  in the comet's  orbit

mean  distance  of  the sun from  the  earth  to  be 100000  parts  ; arid from

  This  comet  also appeared  in the November  before, and  at+ Coburg,2.14       in
Saxony,  was  observed  by Mr.  Gottfried  Kirch,  on  the 4th  of that month,  on
the 6th  and  llth  O.  S. ; from  its positions  to the nearest  fixed  stars observed
with  sufficient  accuracy,  sometimes  with  a two  feet, and  sometimes  with  a
ten  feet telescope;  from  the  difference  of longitudes  of Coburg  and Lon
don, 11°;  and  from  the  places  of the  fixed  stars observed  by Mr. Pound,
Dr. Halley  has determined  the  places of  the comet  as follows   :—

BOOK III.]        OF  NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.     479


  Nov.  3, 17h.  2', apparent  time   fit London,  the comet  was  in  71 29  deg.
51', with  1 deg. 17' 45"  latitude  north.
  November   5. 15h. 58' the comet  was  in ^  3° 23', with  1°  6' nortl  lat.
  November  10,  16h.  31', the comet  was  equally  distant  from  two  stars  in
£1, which  are  <r and  T in Bayer  ; but  it had  not  quite touched  the right
line  that joins  them,  but  was  very  little  distant  from  it.  In Flamstecfs

catalogue  this  star  o was  then  in ^  14°  15', with  1  deg. 41'  lat. north
nearly, and  r in W  17°  3^' with  0  deg. 34'  lat. south;  and  the  middle
point  between  those  stars  was   lrJZ 15°  39}', with  0° 33i'  lat. north.  Let
the distance  of the  cornet  from  that  right  line  be about  10' or  12'  : and
the difference  of  the longitude  of  the comet  and  that middle  point  will  be

7' ; arid the  difference  of the  latitude  nearly  7\' ; and  thence  it follows
that  the comet  was  in  T02 15°  32', with  about  26'  lat. north.
  The   first observation  from  the position  of  the comet  with  respect   tr
certain  small  fixed  stars  had  all the  exactness  that  could  be desired  ; UK
second  also was  accurate enough.  In  the  third  observation,  which  was  the
least  accurate,  there might  be  an  error  of 6  or  7 minutes,  but  hardly
greater.  The  longitude  of the  comet,  as found  in  the  first and  most
accurate  observation,  being computed  in  the  aforesaid  parabolic  orbit,

comes  out U  29°  30' 22",  its latitude  north  1° 25'  7", and  its  distance
from  the sun  115546.

   Moreover,  Dr.  Halley,  observing  that  a remarkable  comet  had  appeared
four  times  at equal  intervals  of 575  years  (that  is, in the month  of Sep
tember  after Julius  Ccesar  was  killed ; An.  Chr.  531,  in the consulate  of
Lainpadins  and  Orestes;  An.  Chr.  1106,  in  the month  of February  ;
and  at the end  of the  year 16SO;  and  that with  a long and  remarkable

tail, except when  it was  seen  after  C(BsaiJs  death,  at which  time, by reason
of the inconvenient,  situation  of the  earth,  the  tail was  not  so conspicuous),
set  himself  to  find  out  an  elliptic  orbit  whose  greater  axis  should  be
1382957  parts,  the mean  distance  of the  earth  from  the  sun  containing
10000  such  ; in which  orbit  a  comet  might  revolve  in 575  years  ; and,

placing  the ascending  node  in  25 2°  2', the inclination  of the plane  of  the
orbit  to the plane  of  the  ecliptic  in an  angle  of 61°  6' 48",  the perihelion
of  the comet  in  this plane in t  22°  44' 25",  the equal  time  of the perihe
lion December   7'1. 23h.  9', the distance  of the  perihelion  from  the ascend
ing node  in the plane  of the  ecliptic  9°^ 17' 35", and  its conjugate  axis
18481,2,  he computed  the motions  of the comet  in this  elliptic orbit.  The
places  of  the comet,  as deduced  from  the  observations,  and  as arising from
computation  made  in  this  orbit, may  be seen  in the following  table.

   The  observations  of  this comet  from  the beginning  to the end  agree  at
porfectly  with  the motion  of  the comet  in the  orbit  just now  described  as
the motions  of  the planets do  with  the  theories  from  whence  they  are  cal
culated  ; and  by this agreement  plainly  evince  that  it was  one  and  the
same  comet  that  appeared  all that  time, and  also that  the  orbit  of  that
comet  is here  rightly  defined.
   In the foregoing  table  we have  omitted  the  observations  of Nov.  16,
18, 20. and  23,  as not  sufficiently  accurate,  for  at those  times  several  per
sons had  observed  the comet.  Nov.  17, O.  S. Ponthczns  and  his compan
ions, at 6h. in the morning  at Rome  (that  is, 5h. 10'  at London],  by threads
directed  to the  fixed  stars, observed  the comet  in  === 8°  30', with  latitude  0°
40' south.  Their  observations  may  be seen  in a treatise which  Ponthc&us
published  concerning  this comet.   Celliits, who  was  present, and commu

south  ; and  Cellius  in ^  13°  30', with  latitude  1° 00' south.  But  at 5b.
30'  in the morning  at Aviation,  Galletius  saw  it in ^  13°  00', with  lati
tude  1° 00' south.  In the  University  of La  Fleche,  in Prance,  at  5h. in
the morning  (that  is. at 5h. 9' at London.},  it was  seen by P.  An  go, in the
middle  between  two  small  stars, one  of which  is the  middle  of  the three
which  lie in  a right  line  in the southern  hand  of Virgo, Bayers   i/> ; and
the  other  is the outmost  of  the wing, Bayer  s 0.  Whence   the comet  was
then  in ^  12°  46'  with  latitude  50' south.  And  I was  informed  by Dr.
ffalley,  that  on  the same  day  at Boston  in New  England,  in the latitude

of 42|  deg. at 5h. in the morning  (that  is, at  9h. 44' in  the morning   at
London),  the comet  was  seen  near   === 14°, with  latitude  1° 30'  south.
  Nov.  19, at  4|h. at Cambridge,  the  comet  (by  the  observation  of  a
young  man)  was  distant  from  Spica  '$ about  2° towards  the  north  west.
Now  the spike was  at that  time  in ^  19°  23'  47", with  latitude  2°  1' 59"
south.  The  same  day,  at  5h. in the morning,  at Boston  in New  England,
the comet  wTas distant  from  Spica   nj? 1°, with  the  difference  of 40'  in  lati
tude.  The  same  day, in  the  island  of Jamaica,  it was  about  1° distant
from  Spica W.  The  same  day, Mr. Arthur  Storer,  at the  river Patuxent,
near Hunting  Creek,  in Maryland,  in  the  confines  of  Virginia,  in  lat.
38i°,  at 5  in  the morning  (that  is, at  10h. at  London),  saw  the  comet
above  Spica  W, and  very  nearly  joined  with  it, the distance  between  them
being  about  £ of one deg.  And  from  these  observations  compared,  I con
clude,  that  at 9h. 44'  at London,  the comet  was  in  === 18°  50', with  about
1° 25'  latitude south.  Now  by the theory  the comet  was  at that time  in
^  18°  52'  15", with  1° 26' 54"  lat. south.
   Nov.  20, Montenari,  professor  of astronomy  at Padua,  at  6h. in  the
morning  at  Venice  (that  is, 5h. 10' at London),  saw  the  comet  in  === 23°,
with  latitude  1° 30' south.  The  same  day, at Boston,  it was  distant  from
Spica  W  by about  4° of longitude  east, and  therefore  was  in ^  23°  24'
nearly.

   Nov.  21, Ponthceus  and  his companions,  at  7|h. in  the morning,  ob
served  the comet  in  =£= 27°  50', with  latitude  1°  16' south ; Cellius,  in  ^=
28°  ; P.  An go  at  5h. in  the  morning,  in  === 27°  45'; Montenari  in ^
27° 51'.  The  same  day,  in the  island  of Jamaica,  it was  seen  near  the
beginning  of  ^1, and  of about  the same  latitude  with  Spica  u%, that  is, 2°
2'.  The  same  day, at  5h. morning,  at Ballasore,  in the East  Indies  (that
is, at  llh.  20'  of the  night  preceding  at London),  the  distance  of  the
comet  from  Spica  W  was  taken  7°  35'  to the east.  It was  in  a right  line
between  the  spike and  the balance, and  therefore  was  then  in  =£= 26°  58',
with  about  1° 11'  lat. south;  and  after  5h. 40' (that  is. at  5h. morning  at
 London),  it was  in  === 28°  12'. with  1° 16'  lat. south.  Now  by the theory
 the comet  was  then  in  *= 28°  10' 36", with  1° 53' 35"  lat. south.

482           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    111.

in New  England,   it was  found  in about  ^l 3°, and  with  almost  the same
latitude  as  before, that  is, 1° 30'.  The  same  day,  at  5h. morning  at
Ballasore,  the comet  was  observed  in  ^l 1° 50'  ; and  therefore  at  5h. morn
ing at London,  the comet  was  in  iU 3°  5' nearly.  The  same  day,  at 6^h.
in the morning  at London,  Dr. Hook  observed  it in about  nt 3°  30', and
that  in the right  line which  passeth  through  Spica  ^  and  Cor  Leonis  ;
not, indeed,  exactly, but  deviating  a  little from  that  line towards  the
north.  Montenari  likewise  observed,  that  this day, and some  days  after,
a  right  line drawn  from  the comet  through  Spica  passed  by the south
side of Cor  Lt>oi\is  at  a very  small  distance  therefrom.  The  right  line
through  Cor  Leonis  and Spica  ^  did cut  the  ecliptic in ^  3° 46'  at  an
ano-le  of 2°  51'  ; and  if the comet  had  been  in this  line and  in  W. 3°, its
latitude  would  have  been  2°  26' ; but  since Hook  and Montenari  agree
that  the  comet  was  at some  small  distance  from  this  line  towards  the
north,  its latitude  must  have  been  something  less. On  the 20th, by the
observation  of Montenari,  its latitude  was  almost  the same  with  that  of

Spica   ^l7, that  is, about  1° 30'.  But  by the agreement  of Hook,  Monte-
nari, and  Align,  the  latitude  was  continually  increasing, and  therefore

must  now,  on  the  22ci  be  sensibly  greater  than  t° 30' :  and, taking  a
mean  between  the extreme  limits  but  now  stated.  2° 26'  and  1° 30', the
latitude  will be  about  1° 58'.  Hook  and  Montenari  agree  that  the  tail
of  the comet  was  "directed  towards  Spica  W, declining  a little from  that
star towards  the south  according  to Hook,  but  towards  the north  according
to Montenari  ; and,  therefore,  that  declination  was  scarcely  sensible  ; and
the  tail, lying  nearly  parallel  to the equator,  deviated  a little from  the op
position  of  the sun  towards  the  north.
   Nov.  23, O.  S. at  51. morning,  at Nuremberg  (that  is, at 4^h. at Lon
don), Mr. Zimmerman   saw  the  comet  in  ^t 8°  8', with  2°  31' south  lat.
its place being  collected  by taking  its distances  from  fixed  stars.
   Nov.  24, before  sun-rising,  the comet  was  seen by Montenari  in  TCI 1?°
52'  on  the north  side of  the right  line through  Cor  Leonis  and  Spica  W,
and  therefore  its latitude  was  something  less than  2°  38' ; and  since  the
latitude,  as we  said, by the  concurring  observations  of Montenari,  A/io-0,
and Hook,  was  continually  increasing,  therefore,  it was  now,  on  the 24th,

something  greater  than  1° 58"  ; and, taking  the mean  quantity, may  be
reckoned  2°  18", without  any  considerable  error.  Ponthwns  and  Galletins
will have  it that  the  latitude  was  now  decreasing  ; and  Cellius,  and  the
observer  in New  England,  that  it continued  the same,  viz., of about  1°,
or H°.  The  observations  of Ponthceus  and  Cellius  are more  rude,  espe
cially those which  were  made  by taking  the azimuths  and  altitudes  ; as
 are  also  the  observations  of  Galletins.  Those  are  better which  were
made  by taking  the position  of  the comet  to the  fixed  stars by Montenari^
Hook,  Ango,  and  the  observer  in New  England,  and  sometimes  by

| that the com | et was | at some | small dista | nce from this line t | owards the |

| Spica ^l7, tha | t is, ab | out 1° 3 | 0'. But by t | he agreement of Hoo | k, Monte- |

| of the comet | was "d | irected t | owards Spica | W, declining a little | from that |
| star towards | the sou | th accor | ding to Hook, | but towards the north | according |
| to Montenari | ; and | , therefor | e, that declin | ation was scarcely sen | sible ; and |
| the tail, lyin | g nearl | y parallel | to the equato | r, deviated a little f | rom the op |

Po   ii t/tfe  n.fi and  Cell'lus.  The  same  day,  at  5h. morning,  at Ballasore,  the
comet  was  observed  in  "I 11°  45'  ; and,  therefore,  at 5h. morning  at Lon
don, was  in  "I 13° nearly.  And, by  the  theory, the  comet  was  at  that
time  in n  13°  22'  42".
   Nov.  25,  before  sunrise. Montenari  observed  the  comet  in  1Tl 17|
nearly  ; and  Cellius  observed  at the same  time  that  the comet  was  in  a
right  line  between  the  bright'  star in  the  right  thigh  of Virgo  and  the

southern  scale  of Libra;  and  this  right  line  cuts  the  comet's  way  in  ^l
 18° 3(5'.  And,  by the  theory,  the comet  was  in  ni  18-£-° nearly.
  From   all this  it is plain that  these  observations  agree  with  the  theory,
so  far  as they  agree  with  one  another  ; and  by this agreement  it is made
clear  that  it was  one  and  the same  comet  that  appeared  all the time  from
Nov.  4  to Mar.  9.  The  path  of this comet  did  twice  cut  the plane  of  the
ecliptic, and  therefore  was  not  a right line.  It did  cut  the  ecliptic not  in
opposite  parts  of the  heavens,  but  in the end  of Virgo  and  beginning  of

Capricorn,  including  an  arc  of about  98°  : and  therefore  the way  of  the
comet  did very much  deviate  from  the  path  of  a great  circle ; for  in the

month  of Nov.  it declined  at least  3° from  the  ecliptic towards  the south   :
and  in the month  of Dec.  following  it declined  29° from  the  ecliptic  to
wards  the north  ; the  two  parts  of  the  orbit  in which  the comet  descended
towards  the sun,  and  ascended  again  from  the sun, declining  one from  the

other  by an  apparent  angle  of above  30°,  as observed  by Montenari.  This
comet  travelled  over  9 signs,  to wit, from  the  last dcg. of  £1  to the begin

ning of  n, beside  the sign of  £1, through  wrhich  it passed  before  it began
to be seen  ; and  there  is no  other  theory by which   a comet  can  go  over  so
great  a part  of the  heavens  with  a regular motion.  The  motion  of  this
comet  was  very  unequable ; for about  the 20th  of Nov.  it described  about

5° a day.  Then  its motion  being  retarded  between  Nov.  26  and  Dec.
12, to wit, in the  space  of 15^  days,  it described  only 40°'  But  the mo
tion  thereof  being  afterwards  accelerated,  it described  near  5°  a day,  till
its motion  began  to be again retarded.  And  the theory which  justly  cor
responds  with  a motion  so unequable,  and  through  so great  a part of  the
heavens,  which  observes  the same  laws  with  the theory  of  the  planets, and
which  accurately  agrees  with  accurate  astronomical  observations,  cannot
be otherwise  than  true.

   And,  thinking  it would  not  be improper,  1 have  given  a true representa
tion  of the  orbit which  this comet  described,  and  of  the  tail which  it
emitted  in several  places, in the annexed  figure;  protracted  in the plane  of
the trajectory.  In  this scheme ABC  represents  the  trajectory  of the comet,

the observation  of Mr.  Flamsted),  the  tail passed  through  the  middle  of
the distance  intercepted  between  the  tail of the Serpent  of Ophiuchus  and
the  star 6  in  the south  wing  of Aquila,  and  did  terminate  near  the  stars

A, w,  l>, in Bayer's  tables.  Therefore  the end  of  the  tail was  in Y? 19|5;
with  latitude  about  34^°  north  ; Dec  11, it ascended  to the  head  of Sag-it-
ta (Bayer's  a, 0), terminating  in  V? 26°  43', with  latitude  38°  34' north;
Dec.  12, it passed through  the  middle  of Sa^itta,  nor  did  it reach much
farther;  terminating  in ~  4°, with  latitude  42^°  north  nearly.  But  these
things  are  to be understood  of  the length  of  the brighter  part of  the  tail;
for with  a more  faint  light, observed,  too, perhaps,  in  a  serener  sky,  at

Rome,  Dec.  12, 5h. 40', by the observation  of  Pon.thcBu.Sj  the  tail arose  to
10° above  the rump  of  the Swan,  and  the  side  thereof  towards  the  west
and  towards  the north  was  45' distant  from  this star.  But  about  that  time
the  tail was  3° broad  towards  the  upper  end ; and  therefore  the  middle
thereof  was  2°  15' distant  from  that  star towards  the  south, and  the upper
end was  X  in 22°, with  latitude  61° north;  and  thence  the  tail was  about
70° long;  Dec.  21, it extended  almost  to Cassiopeia's  chair,  equally  dis
tant from  j3 and  from  Schedir,  so  as  its distance  from  either  of  the two
was  equal  to the distance  of  the one from  the  other, and  therefore  did  ter
minate  in T  24°, with  latitude  47^° ; Dec.  29, it reached  to  a contact  with
Scheal  on  its left, and  exactly  filled up the  space between  the  two  stars  in

the northern  foot of Andromeda,  being  54°  in length;  and  therefore  ter
minated  in &  19°, with  35°  of latitude; Jan  5, it touched  the  star   -rr in
the  breast  of Andromeda   on  its right  side, and  the  star  \i of  the girdle  on
its left; and,  according  to our  observations,  was  40°  long;  but  it was
curved,  and  the convex  side  thereof  lay  to the south  ; arid near  the head  of

the comet  it made  an  angle  of 4° with  the  circle which  passed through  the
sun  and  the comet's  head ; but towards  the  other  end  it was  inclined  to
that  circle  in an  angle  of about  10°  or  11°  ; and  the chord  of the  tail con
tained  with  that  circle  an  angle  of 8°.  Jan.  13, the  tail terminated  be
tween Alamech  and  Algol,  with  a light  that  was  sensible  enough  : but

with  a faint  light  it ended  over  against  the  star  K in Perseus' s side.  The
distance  of the end  of the  tail from  the  circle passing  through  the  sun  and
the comet  was  3°  50' ; and  the inclination  of  the chord  of  the  tail to that
circle was S|°.  Jan.  25  and  26,  it shone  with  a faint  light  to the length
of 6°  or 7° ; and  for  a night  or two  after, when  there  was  a very  clear  sky.
it extended  to the length  of  12°.  or something  more,  with  a light  that  was
very  faint  and  very hardly  to be seen;  but  the  axis  thereof  was  exactly  di
rected  to the bright  star  in the eastern  shoulder  of Auriga,  and  therefore
deviated  from  the opposition  of the  sun  towards  the  north  by an  angle  of

10°.  Lastly,  Feb.  10, with  a telescope  I observed  the  tail 2° long ; for that
fainter  light which  I spoke  of did  not appear  through  the glasses.  But
Ponthftiis  writes,  that, on  Feb.  7, lie saw  the  tail  12° lone:.  Feb.  25, the
fjrnet  was  without  a  tail, and  so continued   till it disappeared

| 10° above | the rump | of the Sw | an, and the side th | ereof towards | the west |
| and towards | the nor | th was 45' | distant from this st | ar. But about | that time |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the tail was | 3° bro | ad towards | the upper end ; an | d therefore th | e middle |
| thereof was | 2° 15' d | istant from | that star towards | the south, and | the upper |

                             THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III.

  Now   if one  reflects upon  the  orbit  described,  and  duly  considers  the other
appearances  of  this comet,  he  will  be  easily  satisfied  that  the  bodies  of
comets  are  solid, compact,  fixed, and  durable,  like  the bodies  of the planets  ;
for  if they  were  nothing  else but  the vapours  or exhalations  of the earth,  of
the  sun, and  other  planets,  this comet,  in  its passage  by the neighbourhood
of  the sun, would  have  been  immediately  dissipated;  for the  heat  of  the
sun  is as the density  of  its rays, that  is, reciprocally  as the square  of  the
distance  of the  places from  the sun.  Therefore,  since  on Dec.  8, when  the
comet  was  in  its perihelion,  the distance  thereof  from  the centre  of the  sun
was  to the distance  of the  earth  from  the same  as  about  6  to 1000;  the

sun's  heat  on  the comet  was  at that time  to  the  heat  of the summer-sun
with  us  as 1000000  to  36, or  as 28000  to 1.  But  the  heat  of  boiling
water  is about  3 times  greater  than  the  heat which  dry earth  acquires from

the summer-sun,  as I have  tried  : and  the heat  of red-hot  iron  (if my  con
jecture  is right)  is about  three  or four  times  greater  than  the heat  of  boil
ing water.  And  therefore  the heat  which  dry  earth  on  the comet,  while  in
its perihelion, might  have  conceived  from  the  rays  of  the  sun,  was  about
2000  times  greater  than  the  heat  of red-hot  iron.  But  by so  fierce a heat,
vapours  and  exhalations,  and  every  volatile  matter,  must  have  been imme
diately consumed  and  dissipated.
   This  comet,  therefore, must  have  conceived  an immense  heat from  the

sun,  and  retained  that  heat  for an  exceeding  long- time ; for  a globe  of iron
of an  inch  in diameter,  exposed  red-hot  to  the open  air, will  scarcely  lose

all its heat  in an  hour's  time;  but  a  greater  globe would  retain  its heat
longer  in the proportion  of its diameter,  because  the surface  (in proportion
to which  it is cooled  by the  contact  of the ambient  air) is in that proportion
less in respect  of  the quantity  of the included  hot matter;  and  therefore  a
globe of red  hot  iron  equal  to our  earth,  that  is, about 40000000   feet  in
diameter,  would  scarcely  cool  in an  equal number  of  days,  or in above
50000  years.  But  I suspect  that  the duration  of heat  may,  on  account  of
some  latent  causes,  increase  in  a  yet  less proportion  than  that  of  the
diameter  ; and  I should  be glad that  the  true  proportion  was  investigated
by experiments.
   It is farther  to be observed,  that  the comet  in  the month  of December.
just after  it had  been  heated  by the sun, did emit  a much  longer  tail, and
much  more  splendid,  than  in the month  of November   before, when  it had
not yet arrived  .it its perihelion;  and, universally,  the greatest  and  most
fulgent  tails always  arise  from  comets  immediately   , fter their passing by
the neighbourhood  of  the sun.  Therefore  the heat  received  by the comet
conduces  to the greatness  of  the  tail: from  whence,  I thiufc  I may  infer,
that  the  tail  is nothing  else but  a very  fine vapour,  which  the head  or
 nucleus  of the comet  emits  by  its heat.
   Jbut  we have  had  three  several  opinions  about  the  tails of comets;  for

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comets are | solid, comp | act, fixed, | and durable, | like the b | odies | of the planets |
| for if they | were noth | ing else b | ut the vapours | or exhalat | ions | of the earth, of |

| the sun, an | d other pl | anets, this | comet, in its | passage b | y the | neighbourhood |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun is as th | e density | of its ray | s, that is, re | ciprocally | as the | square of the |
| distance of | the places | from the | sun. Theref | ore, since | on Dec | . 8, when the |
| comet was | in its perih | elion, the | distance ther | eof from t | he cen | tre of the sun |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| was to the | distance o | f the ear | th from the | same as a | bout | 6 to 1000; the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun's heat | on the com | et was at | that time to | the heat | of th | e summer-sun |
| with us as | 1000000 | to 36, or | as 28000 to | 1. But | the h | eat of boiling |
| water is ab | out 3 time | s greater | than the heat | which dry | earth | acquires from |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the summer- | sun, as I | have trie | d : and the he | at of red- | hot ir | on (if my con |
| jecture is r | ight) is ab | out three | or four times | greater th | an the | heat of boil |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ing water. | And ther | efore the | heat which d | ry earth on | the c | omet, while in |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| vapours and | exhalatio | ns, and e | very volatile | matter, mu | st hav | e been imme |

| This com | et, therefo | re, must | have conceiv | ed an imm | ense | heat from the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| all its heat | in an hour | 's time; | but a greate | r globe wo | uld | retain its heat |

| to which it | is cooled | by the con | tact of the am | bient air) | is in t | hat proportion |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

some  will have  it that they  are  nothing  else but  the beams  of  the  sun's
light transmitted  through  the  comets'  heads,  which  they suppose  to  be
transparent  ; others,  that they proceed  from  the refraction  which  light suf

fers in passing  from  the comet's  head  to the  earth  : and,  lastly, others,  thac
they  are  a sort  of clouds  or vapour  constantly  rising from  the comets7  heads.
and  tending  towards  the parts  opposite  to the sun.  The  first  is the opin
ion  of such  as  are  yet unacquainted  with  optics : for the beams  of  the sun
are  seen  in a darkened  room  only in consequence  of  the light  that  is re
flected from  them  by the  little particles  of dust  and  smoke  which  are
always  flying about  in the  air;  and,  for that  reason,  in  air impregnated
with  thick  smoke,  those beams  appear  with  great  brightness,  and  move  the
sense  vigorously  ; in  a  yet finer  air they appear  more  faint, and  are  less
easily discerned  ; but  in the  heavens,  where  there  is no  matter  to reflect
the light  they  can  never  be seen  at all.  Light  is not  seen  as  it is in the
beam,  but  as  it is thence  reflected  to our  eyes ; for vision  can  be no  other
wise  produced  than  by rays  falling upon  the  eyes  ; and.  therefore,  there
must  be some  reflecting  matter  in those  parts where  the  tails  of the comets
are  seen  : for otherwise,  since  all the  celestial  spaces  are  equally  illumin

ated by  the  sun's  light, no  part  of the  heavens  could  appear  with  more
splendor  than another.  The  second  opinion  is liable  to many  difficulties.
The  tails of comets  are  never  seen  variegated  with  those  colours  which
commonly  are  inseparable  from  refraction  ; and  the  distinct  transmission
of  the  light of the  fixed  stars and  planets  to  us  is a demonstration  that
the  aether  or  celestial medium   is not  endowed  with  any  refractive  power   :
for  as  to what  is alleged,  that  the  fixed  stars have  been  sometimes  seen by
the Egyptians  environed  with  a Coma  or Capit/itinm,  because  that  has

but rarely  happened,  it  is rather  to be  ascribed   to' a  casual  refraction  of
clouds;  and  so  the  radiation  and  scintillation  of the  fixed  stars  to  tin
refractions  both  of  the eyes  and  air ; for upon  laying  a telescope  to  the
eye, those  radiations  and  scintillations  immediately  disappear.  By  the trem
ulous  agitation  of the  air and  ascending  vapours,  it happens  that  the rays  of
light  are alternately  turned  aside from  the narrow  space  of the pupil  of the
eye; but  no  such  thing  can have  place  in the much  wider  aperture  of the ob
ject-glass  of a telescope  ; and  hence  it is that  a scintillation  is occasioned   ir,
the former  case, wrhich  ceases  in the  latter  ; and  this cessation  in the  latter
case  is a demonstration  of the  regular  transmission  of light through  the
heavens, without  any  sensible  refraction.  But, to  obviate  an  objection
that may  be made  from  the appearing  of no  tail in such  comets  as shine
but with  a faint  light, as if the secondary  rays  were  then  too weak  to af
fect the  eyes, and  for  that  reason  it is that  the  tails of  the  fixed  stars  do
not  appear,  we  are  to consider,  that by the means  of telescopes  the light of
the fixed  stars may  be augmented  above  an  hundred  fold, and  yet no  tails
are  seen  ; that the  light of the  planets  is yet  more  copious  without  any

tail ; but  that comets  are  seen sometimes  with  huge  tails, when  the light
of their heads  is but  faint and  dull.  For  so  it happened  in the comet  of
the year  1680, when  in the month  of December   it was  scarcely equal  in
light  to the  stars  of  the second  magnitude,  and  yet  emitted  a notable  tail,

extending  to the length  of  40°, 50°,  60°, or  703, and upwards  ; and  after
wards,  on  the 27th  and 28th  of January,  when  the  head  appeared  but  us
a star of  the 7th  magnitude,  yet  the  tail (as we  said  above),  with  a light
that  was  sensible  enough,  though  faint, was  stretched  out  to 6 or 7 degrees
in length, and  with  a languishing  light that  was  more  difficultly  seen,  even

to  .12°, and upwards.  But  on  the 9th and  10th  of February,  when  to the
naked  eye  the head  appeared  no  more, through  a telescope  I viewed  the

tail  of 2° in length.  But  farther;  if the  tail was  owing  to the  refrac
tion  of the  celestial  matter,  and  did  deviate  from  the opposition  of  the
sun, according  to the  figure  of the  heavens,  that  deviation  in the  same
places of the heavens  should  be always  directed  towards  the same  parts.

Bu   n  e comet  of the year  1680, December  28d.  S^h. P. M.  at London,  was
seen  in X  8°  41', with  la'itude  north  28°  6' ; while  the sun  was  in V?  18°
26'.  And  the  cornet  of the year  1577, December  29d. was  in X  8°  41',
with  latitude  north 28   40', and  the  sin,  as before,  in about  V^ 18°  26'.
In both  cases  the situation  of the  earth  was  the  same,  and  the comet  ap
peared  in the  same  place of the  heavens  ; yet  in  the former  case  the  tail
of  the comet  (as well by my  observations  as by  the observations  of others)
deviated  from  the opposition  of  the sun  towards  the north  by an angle  of
4|- degrees  ; whereas  in the  latter  there  was  (according  to the observations
of  Tychfi)  a deviation  of 21  degrees  towards  the south.  The  refraction,
therefore,  of the  heavens  being  thus  disproved,  it remains  that  the pha-
tio'mena  of the  tails  of comets  must  be derived  from  some  reflecting  matter.
  And  that  the  tails  of comets  do  arise from  their  heads, and  tend  towards

the parts  opposite  to the  sun,  is. farther  confirmed  from  the  laws  which

the  tails observe.  As  that, lying  in  the  planes  of the  comets'  orbits
which  pass  tl trough  the sun, they constantly  deviate  from  the opposition

of  the sun  towards  the  parts which  the  comets'  heads  in  their  progress
along  these  orbits have  left.  That  to  a spectator,  placed  in those  planes,
 they appear  in the  parts directly  opposite  to the sun  ; but, as the spectator
recedes  from  th  >se planes,  their  deviation  begins  to appear,  and  daily be
comes  greater.  That  the  deviation,  cceteris paribus,  appears  less when
 the  tail  is more  oblique  to  the  orbit of  the  comet,  as well  as when  the
 head  of  the comet  approaches  nearer  to the  sun,  especially  if the angle  of
 deviation  is estimated  near  the head  of the comet.  That  the  tails which
 have  no deviation  appear  straight, but  the  tails which  deviate  are like
 wise bended  into  a certain  curvature.  That  this curvature  is greater when

 the deviation  is greater  ; and  is more  sensible when  the  tail, cceteris pari-
 bus  is longer ; for in the shorter  tails  the  curvature  is hardly  to be  p-jr-

| Bu n e comet | of the year | 1680, December | 28d. S^h. P. M. at L | ondon, was |

| with latitude | north 28 | 40', and the sin | , as before, in about | V^ 18° 26'. |
| In both cases | the situation | of the earth w | as the same, and th | e comet ap |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| peared in the | same place | of the heavens ; | yet in the former | case the tail |
| of the comet | (as well by | my observations | as by the observation | s of others) |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| deviated from | the oppositi | on of the sun t | owards the north by | an angle of |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| 4|- degrees ; w | hereas in th | e latter there wa | s (according to the | observations |

| therefore, of | the heavens | being thus dis | proved, it remains th | at the pha- |
| tio'mena of th | e tails of com | ets must be deri | ved from some reflec | ting matter. |
| And that t | he tails of co | mets do arise fr | om their heads, and t | end towards |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| the parts opp | osite to the | sun, is. farther | confirmed from the | laws which |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| the tails obs | erve. As t | hat, lying in t | he planes of the co | mets' orbits |

ccived.  That  the angle  of deviation  is less near  the comet's  head,  but
greater  towards  the  other  end  of the  tail ; and  that because  the convex
side of  the  tail regards  the  parts from  which  the  deviation  is made,  and
which  lie  in a  right  line drawn  out  infinitely from  the sun  through  the
comet's head.  And  that  the  tails that  are long and  broad, and  shine  with
a stronger  light, appear  more  resplendent  and  more  exactly  defined  on  the
convex  than  on  the  concave  side.  Upon  which  accounts  it is plain  that
the phenomena  of  the  tails  of comets  depend  upon  the motions  of  their
heads, and  by no  means  upon  the  places  of  the heavens  in which  their
heads  are  seen  ; and  that, therefore,  the  tails of comets  do not  proceed  from
the refraction  of  the heavens,  but from  their own  heads, which  furnish  the
matter  that forms  the tail.  For,  as in our  air, the smoke  of a heated  body
ascends  either  perpendicularly  if the  body  is  at  rest, or  obliquely  if the
body  is moved  obliquely,  so  in the heavens,  where  all bodies  gravitate  to
wards  the  sun, smoke  and  vapour  must  (as we  have  already  said) ascend
from  the  sun, and  either  rise perpendicularly  if the smoking  body  is at
rest, or obliquely  if the body,  in  all the  progress  of  its motion,  is always
leaving  those  places  from  which  the upper  or higher  parts  of  the vapour
had  risen  before  ; and  that  obliquity  will  be least where  the vapour  ascends
with  most  velocity,  to  wit, near  the smoking  body, when  that  is near  the
sun.  But, because  the  obliquity  varies,  the column  of vapour  will  be  in-
curvated  ; and  because  the vapour  in the preceding  sides  is something  more
 recent,  that  is, has  ascended  something  more  late from  the body,  it will
 therefore  be something  more  dense  on  that  side, and  must  on  that  account
 reflect more  light, as  well  as be better defined.  I add  nothing  concerning
 the sudden  uncertain  agitation  of  the  tails of comets,  and  their  irregular
 figures, which  authors  sometimes  describe, because  they may  arise from  the
mutations  of our  air, and  the motions  of our  clouds,  in  part obscuring
 those  tails ; or, perhaps,  from  parts  of the  Via Laclea,  which  might  have
 been confounded  with  and  mistaken  for  parts  of the  tails of the comets   JIB
 they passed  by.
   But  that  the  atmospheres  of comets  may  furnish  a supply  of vapour
 great enough  to  fill so immense  spaces,  we may  easily understand  from  the
 rari ty of our  own  air ; for the  air near  the surface  of  our  earth  possesses
 a space 850  times  greater  than  water  of the  same  weight  ; arid therefore
 a cylinder  of air 850  feet high  is of equal weight  with  a cylinder  of water
 of  the same  breadth,  and  but  one  foot high.  But  a cylinder  of  air reach
 ing  to the top  of the  atmosphere  is of equal  weight  with  a  cylinder  of
 water  about  33  feet high  : and,  therefore,  if from  the  whole  cylinder  of
 air the lower  part  of 850  feet high  is taken  away,  the remaining  upper
 part  will  be of equal weight  with  a cylinder  of water  32  feet high  : and
 from  thence  (and by the  hypothesis,  confirmed  by many  experiments,  that
 the compression  of  air  is as  the weight  of  the incumbent  atmosphere,  and

| which lie in | a right | line dra | wn out infinitely | from the sun t | hrough the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comet's head | . And th | at the tai | ls that are long | and broad, and | shine with |
| a stronger li | ght, appea | r more r | esplendent and m | ore exactly defi | ned on the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the phenomen | a of the | tails of | comets depend | upon the motion | s of their |
| heads, and b | y no mea | ns upon | the places of t | he heavens in w | hich their |

| the refraction | of the h | eavens, b | ut from their ow | n heads, which f | urnish the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| matter that f | orms the | tail. For | , as in our air, | the smoke of a h | eated body |
| ascends eithe | r perpend | icularly | if the body is a | t rest, or obliqu | ely if the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| body is moved | obliquel | y, so in | the heavens, whe | re all bodies gr | avitate to |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from the sun, | and eit | her rise | perpendicularly | if the smoking | body is at |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rest, or obliq | uely if th | e body, i | n all the progre | ss of its motion, | is always |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| leaving those | places f | rom which | the upper or | higher parts of | the vapour |
| had risen bef | ore ; a nd | that obliq | uity will be leas | t where the vapo | ur ascends |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| with most ve | locity, to | wit, near | the smoking b | ody, when that | is near the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun. But, b | ecause th | e obliquit | y varies, the co | lumn of vapour | will be in- |
| curvated ; a n | d because | the vapou | r in the precedi | ng sides is somet | hing more |
| recent, that | is, has as | cended so | mething more | late from the bo | dy, it will |
| therefore be | something | more de | nse on that side | , and must on th | at account |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| reflect more | light, as | well as be | better defined. | I add nothing | concerning |
| the sudden u | ncertain | agitation | of the tails of | comets, and thei | r irregular |

| But that | the atmo | spheres | of comets may | furnish a supply | of vapour |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rari ty of our | own air | ; f or the | air near the sur | face of our eart | h possesses |

400           THE   MATHEMATICAL  PRINCIPLES    [BOOK    III

that  the  force  of gravity  is reciprocally  as the square  of the distance  from
the centre  of  the earth) raising  a calculus, by Cor.  Prop. XXII,  Book   II,
I found,  that, at  the height  of  one  semi-diameter  of the  earth, reckoned
from  the  earth's  surface,  the  air  is more  rare  than  with  us in u far greater
proportion  than  of the whole  space  within  the orb  of Saturn  to  a spherical
space  of one  inch  in diameter  ; and  therefore  if  a sphere  of  our  air  of but
one  inch  in  thickness  was  equally  rarefied  with  the  air  at the height  of
one  semi-diameter  of  the earth  from  the  earth's  surface,  it would  rill all
the regions  of the planets  to the orb  of Saturn,  and  far beyond  it. Where
fore  since  the  air  at greater  distances  is immensely  rarefied, and  the coma
or atmosphere  of comets  is ordinarily  about  ten  times  higher, reckoning
from  their  centres, than  the surface  of  the nucleus,  and  the  tails rise  yet
higher,  they must  therefore  be  exceedingly  rare  ; and  though,  on  account
of  the much  thicker  atmospheres  of comets,  and  the  great gravitation  of
their  bodies  towards  the  sun,  as  well  as  of the  particles  of  their  air and
vapours  mutually  one towards  another,  it may  happen  that  the  air in the
celestial  spaces  and  in  the  tails  of comets  is not  so  vastly  rarefied,  yet
from  this computation  it is plain  that  a  very  small  quantity  of  air and
vapour  is abundantly  sufficient  to produce  all the appearances  of the  tails
of comets  : for that  they  are, indeed,  of a very  notable  rarity appears  from
the shining  of the  stars through  them.  The  atmosphere  of the  earth,

illuminated  by the  sun's  light, though  but  of a few  miles  in thickness,
quite  obscures  and  extinguishes  the light not  only  of  all the  stars, but
even  of the moon  itself; whereas  the  smallest  stars  are  seen  to  shine
through  the immense  thickness  of  the  tails  of comets,  likewise  illuminated
by the  sun, without  the  least diminution  of  their splendor.  Nor  is the
brightness  of  the  tails of most  comets  ordinarily  greater  than  that  of  our
air, an  inch  or two  in thickness,  reflecting  in a darkened  room  the light  of
the sun-beams  let in by a hole  of  the window-shutter.
   And  we  may  pretty  nearly  determine  the  time  spent  during  the  ascent
of  the vapour  from  the comet's  head  to the extremity  of the  tail, by draw
ing  a right  line from  the  extremity  of the  tail  to the  sun, and  marking
the place where  that  right  line  intersects  the comet's  orbit  : for the vapour
that  is now  in the extremity  of the  tail, if it has ascended  in a right  line
from  the  sun, must  have  begun  to  rise from  the head  at the time when  the
head  was  in the point  of intersection.  It is true,  the vapour  does  not  rise
in  a right  line from  the sun, but, retaining  the motion  Avhich  it had  from
the comet  before  its ascent,  and compounding  that motion  witli  its motion
of  ascent,  arises  obliquely  ; and,  therefore,  the solution  of the Problem  will
be more  exact,  if we  draw  the  line which  intersects  the orbit  parallel  to
the length  of the  tail ; or rather  (because  of  the curvilinear  motion  of the
comet)  diverging  a  little from  the  line  or  length  of the  tail. And  by
means  of  this principle  I found  that  the vapour  which,  Ja/iutiry  25, was

in the extremity  of  the  tail, had  begun  to rise from  the head  before De
cember  11, and  therefore  had  spent  in its whole  ascent  45  days ; but  that
the whole  tail which  appeared  on December  10  had  finished  its ascent  in

the space  of  the  two  days  then  elapsed from  the  time  of  the comet's  being
in its perihelion.  The  vapour,  therefore,  about  the beginning  and  in the
neighbourhood  of  the sun  rose  with  the  greatest  velocity, and  afterwards
continued  to ascend  with  a motion  constantly  retarded  by its own  gravity   ;
and  the  higher  it ascended,  the more  it added  to the length  of  the  tail ;
and  while  the  tail continued  to be seen,  it was  made  up  of almost  all that

vapour  which  had  risen  since  the time  of  the comet's  being  in  its perihe
lion  ; nor  did  that  part  of  the vapour  which  had  risen  first, and  which
funned  the  extremity  of  the  tail, cease  to  appear,  till its too  great  dis
tance,  as  well  from  the  sun, from  which  it received  its li^it, as from  our
eyes, rendered  it invisible. Whence   also  it is that  the  tails of other  comets
which  are  short  do  riot rise from  their heads  with  a  swift  and  continued

motion,  and  soon  after disappear,  but  are permanent  and  lasting columns

of vapours  and  exhalations,  which,  ascending  from  the heads  with  a slow-
motion  of many  days, and  partaking  of  the motion  of the  heads  which
they had  from  the  beginning,  continue  to go  along  together  with  them
through  the heavens.  From  whe-.ee  again  we  have  another  argument
proving  the  celestial  spaces  to be  free, and without  resistance,  since  in
them  not  only  the  solid  bodies  of the  planets  and  comets,  but  also  the  ex

tremely  rare vapours  of comets1  tails, maintain  their  rapid motions  with
great freedom,  and  for an  exceeding  long  time.
   Kepler  ascribes  the  ascent  of  the  tails of the comets  to the atmospheres
of their heads  : and  their  direction  towards  the  parts opposite  to the sun  to
the  action  of the rays  of light carrying  along  with  them  the matter  of  the

comets'  tails ; and  without  any  great incongruity  we may  suppose,  that, in
so free  spaces,  so fine  a matter  as  that  of the  aether may  yield  to the action

of the  rays  of the  sun's  light, though  those  rays  are  not  able sensibly  to
move  the gross  substances  in our  parts, which  are clogged  with  so palpable
 a resistance.  Another  author  thinks  that  there may  be  a sort  of  particles
 of matter  endowed  with  a  principle  of  levity,  as well  as others  are  with  a
power  of  gravity ; that  the matter  of the  tails  of comets  may  be of  the
former  sort, and  that  its ascent  from  the  sun  may  be owing  to its levity ;
 but, considering  that  the gravity  of  terrestrial  bodies  is as  the matter  of
 the  bodies, and  therefore  can  be neither  more  nor  less in the same  quantity
 of matter,  I am  inclined  to believe  that  this ascent  may  rather  proceed from
 the rarefaction  of the matter  of the comets'  tails.  The  ascent  of smoke  in
a chimney  is owing  to  the impulse  of the  air with  which  it is entangled.
The  air rarefied by heat  ascends,  because  its specific gravity  is diminished,
and  in  its ascent  carries  along with  it the smoke  with  which  it is engaged ;
ind why  may  not  the  tail of a comet  rise from  the  sun  after  the same  man-

ner ?  For  the  sun's  rays do  not  act  upon  the mediums  which  they  per
vade  otherwise  than  by reflection  and  refraction  ; and  those  reflecting  par
ticles heated  by  this action, heat  the matter  of the  aether which  is involved

with them.  That  matter  is rarefied by the  heat which  it acquires,  and  be-
oause, by this rarefaction,  the  specific gravity  with  which  it tended  towards
the sun  before  is diminished,  it will ascend  therefrom,  and  carry  along with
it the  reflecting  particles  of which  the  tail of the comet  is composed.  But
the  ascent  of  the vapours  is further  promoted  by their  circumgyration
about  the sun, in consequence  whereof  they endeavour  to  recede from  the

sun, while  the  sun's atmosphere  and  the  other  matter  of the heavens  are
either  altogether  quiescent,  or  are  only moved  with  a slower  circumgyra
tion derived  from  the rotation  of the sun.  And  these  are  the causes  of the

ascent  of the  tails of the  comets  in the neighbourhood  of  the sun, where
their  orbits  are bent  into  a  greater  curvature,  and  the  comets  themselves

are plunged  into  the denser  and  therefore  heavier  parts  of the  sun's atmos
phere  : upon  which  account  they do then  emit  tails  of an huge  length ; for
the  tails which  then  arise, retaining  their own  proper  motion,  and  in the
mean  time  gravitating  towards  the  sun, must  be revolved  in ellipses about
the sun  in like manner  as the  heads  are, and  by that motion  must  always
accompany  the heads, and  freely adhere  to them.  For  the gravitation  ot
the vapours  towards  the sun  can  no  more  force  the  tails  to abandon  the

heads, and  descend  to the sun,*than  the gravitation  of the heads  can  oblige
them  to fall from  the tails.  They  must  by  their common  gravity  either
fall together  towards  the  sun,  or be  retarded  together  in their  comii>ori  as
cent  therefrom  ; and,  therefore  (whether  from  the causes  already  described,
or from  any  others),  the  tails and  heads  of comets  may  easily acquire  and
freely  retain  any  position  one  to the  other, without  disturbance  or impedi
ment  from  that common  gravitation.
  The  tails, therefore,  that  rise in the perihelion  positions  of  the  comets
will go along  with  their  heads  into  far remote  parts, and  together  with
the heads  will  either  return  again  from  thence  to  us, after  a long course  of
years,  or rather  will  be  there  rarefied, and  by degrees  quite vanish  away  ;
for afterwards,  in the descent  of the heads  towards  the  sun,  new  short  tails
will be emitted  from  the heads  with  a slow motion;  and  those  tails by de
grees  will  be augmented  immensely,  especially  in such  comets  as in their

perihelion  distances  descend  as low  as the sun's atmosphere ; for  all vapour
in those  free spaces  is in a  perpetual  state  of  rarefaction  and  dilatation  ;
and  from  hence  it is that  the  tails  of all comets  are broader  at their upper
extremity  than  near  their heads.  And  it is not  unlikely  but  that  the  va
pour,  thus  perpetually  rarefied  and  dilated, may  be  at  last  dissipated  and
scattered  through  the whole  heavens,  and  by little and  little  be attracted
towards  the planets  by its gravity, and  mixed  with  their atmosphere;  for
 as the  seas  are  absolutely  necessary  to  the constitution  of  our  earth,

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| with them. Th | at matter | is rarefied b | y the heat w | hich it a | cquires, and be- |

| the ascent of t | he vapour | s is further | promoted | by their | circumgyration |

from  them,  the sun, by its heat, may  exhale  a sufficient quantity  of vapours,
which,  being  gathered  together  into  clouds, may  drop down  in rain, for
watering  of  the  earth, and  for  the production  and nourishment  of  vegeta
bles;  or, being condensed  with  cold  on  the  tops  of mountains  (as some  phi
losophers  with  reason  judge), may  run  down  in springs  and  rivers;  so for
the conservation  of  the  seas, and  fluids of  the  planets, comets  seem  to be
required,  that, from  their exhalations  and  vapours  condensed,  the wastes  of
the planetary  fluids spent  upon  vegetation  and  putrefaction,  and  converted
into dry  earth, may  be continually  supplied  and  made  up;  for  all vegeta
bles entirely  derive  their growths  from  fluids, and  afterwards,  in great
measure,  are turned  into dry earth  by putrefaction  : and  a sort of  slime  is
always  found  to settle at  the bottom  of  putrefied  fluids; and  hence  it is
that  the bulk  of the  solid  earth  is continually  increased;  and  the  fluids,  if
they  are  not  supplied  from  without,  must  be  in  a continual  decrease,
and  quite  fail  at last.  I suspect,  moreover,  that  it is chiefly from  the
comets  that  spirit comes,  which  is indeed  the smalles;  but  the most  subtle
and  useful  part of  our  air, arid  so much  required  to sustain  the  life of  all
things  with  us.
  The  atmospheres  of comets,  in their  descent  towards  the  sun, by running
out  into  the  tails, are  spent  and  diminished,  and  become  narrower,  at least
on  that  side which  regards  the  sun  ; and  in receding  from  the  sun, when
they  less run  out  into the  tails, they  are  again  enlarged,  if Hevelins  has
justly marked  their appearances.  But  they  are  seen  least  of  all just  after
they have  been  most  heated  by  the  sun,  and  on  that  account  then  emit  the
longest  and  most  resplendent  tails; and,  perhaps,  at  the same  time,  the
nuclei  are environed  with  a  denser  and  blacker  smoke  in  the lowermost

parts  of their atmosphere ; for smoke  that  is raised  by  a great  and  intense
heat  is commonly  the denser  and  blacker.  Thus  the  head  of  that  cornet
which  we  have  been  describing,  at equal  distances  both  from  the sun  and
from  the  earth, appeared  darker  after  it had  passed  by  its perihelion  than
it did  before ; for in the month  of December   it was  commonly  compared
with  the  stars of  the  third magnitude,  but  in November  with  those  of  the
first or second  ; and  such  as saw  both  appearances  have  described  the  first
as of another  and  greater  comet  than  the second.  For, November   19.  this
comet  appeared  to  a young  man  at Cambridge,  though  with  a  pale  and

dull  light, yet equal  to Spica  Virg-inis ; and  at that  time  it shone  with
greater  brightness  than  it did afterwards.  And  Montenari,  November  20,
et. vet. observed  it larger  than  the  stars  of  the  first magnitude,  its  tail
being  then  2  degrees long.  And  Mr.  Storer  (by letters which  have  come
into my  hands)  writes,  that  in  the month  of December,  when  the  tail ap
peared  of the  greatest  bulk  and  splendor,  the head  was  but  small, and  far
less than  that  which  was  seen  in the month  of November  before  sun- rising;
 and, conjecturing  at the cause  of  the  appearance,  he judged  it  to proceed

| always f | ound to | settle a | t the bottom | of putrefied | fluids; and | hence it is |
| that the | bulk of | the sol | id earth is cont | inually incr | eased; and the | fluids, if |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| they are | not s | upplied | from without, | must be i | n a continual | decrease, |

| justly ma | rked t | heir app | earances. But | they are see | n least of all | just after |
| they have | been | most he | ated by the sun | , and on tha | t account then | emit the |

from  there  being  a greater  quantity  of matter  in the  head  at  first, which
was  afterwards  gradually  spent.
  And,  which  farther  makes  for the same  purpose,  I find, that  the heads  of
other  cornets, which  did put forth  tails of  the  greatest  bulk  and  splendor,
have  appeared  but  obscure  and small.  For  in Brazil, March   5, 1 668,  7h.
P. M.; St. N. P.  Valentin  its Esta.'tcws  saw  a comet  near  the horizon,  and
towards  the south  west, with  a head  so  small  as  scarcely  to be discerned,
but with  a tail above  measure  splendid,  so that  the  reflection  thereof  from
the  sea  was  easily seen by those who  stood  upon  the shore ; and  it looked

like  a fiery beam  extended  23°  in length  from  the  west  to south,  almost
parallel  to the horizon.  But  this  excessive  splendor  continued  only  three
days, decreasing  apace  afterwards  ; arid while  the  splendor  was  decreasing,
the bulk  of the  tail increased  : whence  in Portugal   it is said  to have  taken
ap  one  quarter  of the  heavens,  that  is, 45  degrees,  extending  from  west  to
3ast with  a very  notable  splendor, though  the whole  tail was  not  seen  in
those  parts,  becar.sc  the head  was  always  hid under  the horizon  : and  from
the increase  of the hulk  arid decrease  of the splendor  of the  tail, it appears
that  the head  vis  then  in  its recess from  the  sun, and  had  been  very  near
to it in  its perihelion,  as  the comet  of 1680  was.  And  we  read,  in the
Saxon  Chronicle,  of a  like comet  appearing  in  the year  1 106,  the star
whereof  was  small  and  obscure  (as that  of 1680),  but  the splendour  of its
tail w^s  very  bright, and  like a huge  fiery beam  stretched  out  in a direc
tion fetween  the  east and  north,  as Hevelius  has  it also from  Simeon,  the
monk  of Durham.   This  comet  appeared  in the  beginning  of February.
about  the  evening,  and  towards  the  south  west  part  of heaven ; frc-in
whence,  and  from  the position  of the  tail, we  infer  that  the  head  was  near
the sun.  Matthew  Paris  says,  // was  distant from  the sun  by about  a
cubit, from,  three of  the  clock  (rather  six)  till nine, putting  forth a  long
tail.  Such  also was  that most  resplendent  comet  described  by  Aristotle,
lib. 1, Meteor. 6.  The  head  whereof  could  not  be seen, because  it had  set

before  the sun,  or  at least was  hid  under  the  sun's  rays  ; but  next day
it was   seen,  as  well  as might   be ; for, having  left the sun  but  a very  lit
 tle way,  it set immediately  after it. And  the scattered  light of the head,
obscured  by the  too great  splendour  (of the  tail) did  not  yet appear.  But
afterwards  (as Aristotle  says) when  the splendour  (of the  tail) was  now
diminished  (the head  of), the comet  recovered  its native  brightness  ; and
 the splendour  (of its tail) reached  now  to a third  part  of the heavens  (that
 is, to 60°).  This  appearance  was  in  the winter  season  (an. 4, Olymp.
 101), and,  rising  tit Orion's  girdle,  it there  vanished  away.   It is true
 that  the comet  of 1618, which  came  out  directly from  under  the sun's  rays
 with  a very large  tail, seemed  to equal,  if not  to  exceed,  the  stars  of  the
 first magnitude:  but, then, abundance  of  other  comets  have  appeared  yet
 greater  than  this, that put  forth  shorter  tails; some  of which  are  said

| And, which | farther makes fo | r the same pu | rpose, | I find, th | at th | e heads of |
| other cornets, w | hich did put for | th tails of t | he gre | atest bul | k and | splendor, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| have appeared | but obscure and | small. For | in Bra | zil, Mar | ch 5 | , 1 668, 7h. |
| P. M.; St. N. P | . Valentin its Es | ta.'tcws saw | a come | t near t | he ho | rizon, and |
| towards the sou | th west, with a | head so sma | ll as | scarcely | to be | discerned, |
| but with a tail | above measure s | plendid, so t | hat the | reflectio | n th | ereof from |
| the sea was eas | ily seen by those | who stood | upon t | he shore | ; and | it looked |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| like a fiery bea | m extended 23° | in length f | rom th | e west t | o sou | th, almost |
| parallel to the | horizon. But t | his excessive | splend | or conti | nued | only three |
| days, decreasing | apace afterward | s ; arid whil | e the | splendor | was | decreasing, |
| the bulk of the | tail increased : | whence in Po | rtugal | it is sai | d to | have taken |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ap one quarter | of the heavens, | that is, 45 d | egrees, | extendin | g fr | om west to |
| 3ast with a ver | y notable splend | or, though | the wh | ole tail | was | not seen in |
| those parts, bec | ar.sc the head wa | s always hid | under | the hori | zon | : and from |
| the increase of | the hulk arid dec | rease of the | splend | or of the | tail, | it appears |
| that the head v | is then in its re | cess from th | e sun, | and had | been | very near |
| to it in its per | ihelion, as the | comet of 16 | 80 wa | s. And | we r | ead, in the |

| whereof was s | mall and obscure | (as that of | 1680), | but the s | plen | dour of its |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| about the eve | ning, and towar | ds the south | west | part of | heav | en ; frc-in |
| whence, and fr | om the position | of the tail, w | e infer | that the | hea | d was near |
| the sun. Matt | hew Paris says, | // was dist | ant f | rom the | sun | by about a |
| cubit, from, thr | ee of the clock | (rather six) t | ill nine | , putting | for | th a long |
| tail. Such als | o was that most | resplendent | comet | describe | d by | Aristotle, |
| lib. 1, Meteor. | 6. The head w | hereof could | not be | seen, bec | ause | it had set |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| before the sun, | or at least was | hid under | the sun | 's rays | ; but | next day |
| it was seen, as | well as might b | e ; f or, havi | ng lef | t the sun | but | a very lit |
| tle way, it set | immediately aft | er it. And | the sca | ttered li | ght o | f the head, |
| obscured by the | too great splen | dour (of the | tail) di | d not yet | app | ear. But |
| afterwards (as | Aristotle says) | when the s | plendou | r (of the | tail | ) was now |
| diminished (t | he head of), the | comet recover | ed its | native br | ightn | ess ; and |
| the splendour | (of its tail) reach | ed now to a | third p | art of th | e he | avens (that |
| is, to 60°). T | his appearance | was in the | winte | r season | (an. | 4, Olymp. |
| 101), and, risi | ng tit Orion's gi | rdle, it ther | e van | ished aw | ay. | It is true |
| that the comet | of 1618, which | came out dire | ctly f | rom under | the | sun's rays |

 to have  appeared  as big as Jupiter,  others  as big  as Venus,  or  even   as
 the moon.
   We  have  said, that comets  are  a  sort  of planets  revolved  in very  eccen
 tric orbits  about  the sun  : and  as, in  the  planets  which  are  without  tails,
 those  are commonly   less which  are revolved  in  lesser  orbits, and  nearer  to
 the  sun,  so in comets  it is probable  that  those which  in their  perihelion  ap
 proach  nearer  to the  sun  ate  generally  of  less magnitude,  that  they may
 not  agitate  the sun  too much  by their  attractions.  But,  as  to  the  trans
 verse  diameters  of their  orbits, and  the periodic  times  of  their  revolutions,
 1 leave them  to be determined  by comparing  comets  together  ^hich  after
long  intervals  of  time  return  again  in the same  orbit.  In  the mean  time,
 the following  Proposition  may  give some  light  in that  inquiry.

         PROPOSITION   XLIL   PROBLEM   XXII.


              To  correct  a  cornet's  trajectory found  as  above.
   OPERATION   1. Assume  that  position  of the plane  of the trajectory which
was determined  according  to  the  preceding  proposition;  and  select  three
 places  of the comet,  deduced  from  very  accurate  observations,  and  at great
distances  one from  the other.  Then  suppose  A  to represent  the  time  be
tween  the  first observation  and  the  second, and  B  the time  between  the
secoi.d  and  the  third ; but  it will  be convenient  that  in one  of  those  times
 the comet  be in  its perigeon,  or  at  least  not  far from  it. From  those  ap
parent  places  find, by trigonometric  operations,  the  three  true  places  of the
comet  in  that assumed  plane  of  the  trajectory ; then  through  the  places
found,  and  about  the  centre  of the sun  as  the focus, describe  a conic  section
by arithmetical  operations,  according  to Prop. XXL,  Book  1.  Let  the
areas  of this figure which  are  terminated  by radii  drawn  from  the sun  to
the places found  be D  and E;  to wit,  I) the area between  the  first observa
tion and  the second,  and E  the area between  the second  and  third  ; and  let
T  represent  the whole  time  in which  the whole  area D  +  E  should  be de
scribed  with  the velocity  of the comet  found  by Prop. XVI.,  Book   1.
   OPER.  2. Retaining  the inclination  of  the plane  of the trajectory  to the
plane  of the  ecliptic,  let the longitude  of the nodes  of the plane  of the  tra
jectory  be increased  by the  addition  of 20  or 30  minutes,  which  call  P.
Then  from  the aforesaid  three  observed  places of  the  comet  let the  three
true  places  be found  (as before)  in this new  plane;  as  also  the  orbit passing
through  those  places, and  the two  areas  of  the same  described  between  the
two  observations,  which  call d and   e ; and  let t be the whole  time  in which
the whole  area d +  e should  be described.
   OrER.  3. Retaining  the longitude  of the nodes  in the  first operation,  let
the inclination  of the plane  of the  trajectory  to the plane  of the  ecliptic be
increased  by adding  thereto  20'  or  30', which  call Q,.  Then  from  the

|  |  |  |  |  |
| We have s | aid, that comets are a | sort of plan | ets revolved in | very eccen |
| tric orbits abo | ut the sun : and as, in | the planet | s which are wi | thout tails, |
| those are com | monly less which are r | evolved in | lesser orbits, an | d nearer to |
| the sun, so in | comets it is probable t | hat those wh | ich in their pe | rihelion ap |
| proach nearer | to the sun ate genera | lly of less | magnitude, tha | t they may |
| not agitate th | e sun too much by the | ir attracti | ons. But, as to | the trans |
| verse diameter | s of their orbits, and t | he periodic | times of their | revolutions, |
| 1 leave them | to be determined by c | omparing c | omets together | ^hich after |
| long intervals | of time return again | in the same | orbit. In the | mean time, |
| the following | Proposition may give | some light | in that inquiry. |  |

|  | To correct a cornet's tr | ajectory fou | nd as above. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| OPERATION | 1. Assume that positi | on of the pl | ane of the traje | ctory which |
| was determine | d according to the p | receding pr | oposition; and | select three |
| places of the | comet, deduced from ve | ry accurate | observations, a | nd at great |

aforesaid  three  observed  apparent  places of  the comet  let the  three  true
places  be found  in this new  plane,  as  well  as  the  orbit  passing  through
them,  and  the two  areas  of  the same  described  between  the  observation,
which  call d and   £ ; and  let r be the whole  time  in which  the whole  area
(5 -4- £ should  be described.
  Then  taking  C  to 1 as A  to B  ; and G  to 1 as D  to E ; and  g  to 1  as
d  to e;  and  y to 1 as  cJ to c;  let S be the  true  time  between  the  first ob

the  first operation,  I represents  the  inclination  of  the plane  of the  trajec
tory  to the plane  of  the  ecliptic, and K  the longitude  of  either  node,  then
I +  7/Q  will  be the true  inclination  of  the plane  of  the trajectory  to the
plane  of  the  ecliptic, and K  + mP  the  true longitude  of the node.  And.
lastly, if in the  first, second,  and  third  operations,  the quantities  R,  r, and

p, represent  the  parameters  of the  trajectory, and  the quantities   -7",LA  -7,I   -,A.

true  transverse  diameter  of  the trajectory  which  the  comet  describes  ; and
from  the transverse  diameter  given  the  periodic  time  of  the comet  is also
given.  Q.E.I.  But  the periodic  times  of  the revolutions  of comets,  and
the transverse  diameters  of  their  orbits, cannot  be  accurately  enough  de
termined  but  by comparing  comets  together  which  appear  at  different
times.   If, after equal  intervals  of  time,  several  comets  are found  to have
described  the same  orbit, we may  thence  conclude  that  they  are  all but  one
and  the same  comet  revolved  in the same  orbit  ; and  then  from  the times
of  their  revolutions  the transverse  diameters  of  their  orbits  will  be given,
and  from  those  diameters  the  elliptic  orbits themselves  will  be determined.
   To  this purpose  the  trajectories  of many  comets  ought  to be computed,
supposing  those  trajectories  to be parabolic;  for such  trajectories  will
always  nearly  agree  with  the ph&nomena,   as appears  not  only from  the
parabolic  trajectory  of the comet  of the year  1680,  which  I compared
above  with  the observations,  but  likewise  from  that  of  the notable  comet
which  appeared  in the year 1664  and  1665, and  was  observed  by Hevelins,
who, from  his own  observations,  calculated  the  longitudes  and  latitudes
thereof, though  with  little accuracy.  But  from  the same  observations  Dr.
Halley  did again compute  its places;  and  from  those  new  places  deter
mined  its trajectory,  finding  its ascending  node  in n  21°  13' 55"  ; the  in
 clination  of  the orbit  to the  plane  of  the  ecliptic 21°  IS' 40"  ; the  dis
 tance  of  its perihelion  from  the node, estimated  in  the comet's  orbit, 49°
 27'  30",- its perihelion  in P, 8° 40' 30", with  heliocentric  latitude  south

lat.; the second  star  of Aries  was  in w  29°  IT'  IS'', with  8° 28'  16"  north
lat.; and  another  star  of the  seventh  magnitude,  which  I call A, was  in

v  28°  24' 45",  with  8° 28' 33"  north  lat, ~ The  comet  Feb.  7(1. 7h. 30'  tt
Paris  (that  is. Feb.  7'1. 8h. 37' at Dantzick]  O.  S. made  a  triangle  with
those  stars  y and  A. which  was  right-angled  in y;  and  the distance  of  the
comet  from  the  star  y was  equal  to the distance  of  the  stars  y and  A, that

is, 1°  19'  46'' of  a great  circle  ; and  therefore  in the  parallel  of  the  lati
tude  of  the  star y it was  1° 20' 26".  Therefore  if from  the longitude  of
the  star  y there  be subducted  the  longitude  1° 20'  26".  there  will remain
the longitude  of the comet  T  27°  9' 49".  M.  Auzout,  from  this observa
tion  of  his, placed  the comet  in  °1P 27°  0', nearly  ; and, by the  scheme  in
which  Dr. Hooke  delineated  its motion,  it was  then  in T  26°  59' 24 '.  1
place  it in  CP 27°  4' 46'', taking  the middle  between  the two  extremes.
  From  the same  observations,  M. Anzont  made  the latitude  of the  cornet

at that  time  7° and  4' or  5' to the north  ; but he had  done  better  to have
made  it 7°  3' 29",  the  difference  of the latitudes  of the comet  and  the  star
y being  equal  to the  difference  of the longitude  of  the  stars  y and  A.

  Ftbmury   22(i.  71'. 30'  at London,  that  is, February  22''.  8h. 46'  at
Dantzick,  the  distance  of the  comet  from  the  star A, according  to Dr.

JJooke's  observation,  as was  delineated  by himself  in  a scheme,  and  also
by the observations  of M.  Auzout,  delineated  in like manner  by M.  Petit,
was  a  fifth part  of the  distance  between  the star A  and  the  first star  of

Aries,  or  15' 57"  ; and  the  distance  of  the comet  from  a right  line joining
the  star A  and  the  first of  Aries  was  a fourth  part  of  the same  iifth part,

that  is, 4'; and  therefore  the comet  was  in T  28°  29'  46", with  8°  12'
36"  north  lat.

  March   1, 7h. 0' at Londou,  that  is, March   1, 8h. 16'  at Dantzick,  the
comet  was  observed  near  the second  star in  Aries,  the  distance  between
them  being  to the distance  between  the  first and  second  stars  in Aries,  that

is, to 1° 33', as  4 to 45  according  to Dr. Hooke,  or as  2  to 23  according
to M.  Gottiguies.  And,  therefore,  the  distance  of the comet  from  the

second  star  in Aries  was  8' 16" according  to Dr. Hooke,  or  8' 5" according
to M.  Gottignies  ;  or, taking  a mean  between  both,  8' 10".  But,  accord
ing  to M.  Gottignies,  the comet  had gone  beyond  the second  star  of Aries
about  a fourth  or  a fifth part  of  the space  that  it commonly  went  over  in

a day,  to  wit, about  1' 35"  (in which  he agrees  very  well with  M.  Auzo-nf]  ;
or, according  to Dr. Hooke,  not  quite  so much,  as perhaps  only  .1'. Where
fore  if to the longitude  of the  first star  in Aries  we  add  1', and  8' 10"  to
its latitude,  we  shall have  the longitude  of  the comet  T  29°  IS', with  S°
36' 26"  north  lat.

  March   7, 7h. 30'  at Paris  (that  is, March   7, 8h. 37'  at Dantzick),
from  the observations  of M.  Auzout,  the  distance  of  the comet  from  the
second  star in  Aries  was  equal  to  the distance  of  that  star from  the  star

A, that  is, 52/29"  ; and  the  difference  of the  longitude  of the comet  and
the second  star  in  Aries  was  45'  or 46',  or, taking  a mean  quantity,  45'
30"  ; and  therefore  the comet  was  in  tf 0°  2' 48".  From  the scheme  of
the observations  of M. Auzout,  constructed  by M.  Petit, Hevelius  collected

the  latitude  of  the comet  8D 54'.  But  the engraver  did  not  rightly  trace
the  curvature  of the  comet's  way  towards  the  end  of the  motion  ; and
Hevdius,  in the scheme  of M. Auzoiifs  observations  which  he constructed
himself,  corrected  this irregular  curvature,  and  so made  the latitude  of the
comet  8° 55' 30".  And,  by farther  correcting  this  irregularity,  the  lati
tude may  become  8°  56', or 8°  57'.
   This  comet  was  also seen March   9, and  at that  time  its place must  have

been  in  8  0°  18'. with  9° 3f  north  lat. nearly.
   This  comet  appeared  three months  together,  in which  space  of time  it
travelled  over  almost  six  signs, and  in  one  of  the  days  thereof  described
almost  20 deg.  Its course  did  very much  deviate  from  a great  circle, bend
ing towatds  the north,  and  its motion  towards  the end  from  retrograde  be
came  direct  ; and, notwithstanding   its course  was  so uncommon,  yet by the
table  it appears  that  the  theory, from  beginning  to  end, agrees  with  the
observations  no  less accurately  than  the  theories  of  the planets  usually  do
with  the observations  of them  : but  we  are  to subduct  about  2' when  the
comet  was  swiftest, which  we may  effect by taking  off 12"  from  the angle
between  the  ascending  node  and  the perihelion,  or by making  that  angle
493  27' 18".  The  annual  parallax  of both  these  comets  (this and  the
preceding)  was  very  conspicuous,  and  by  its quantity  demonstrates  the  an
nual  motion  of  the earth  in the orbis magnus.
   This  theory  is likewise  confirmed  by the motion  of that  comet,  which
in the year 1683  appeared  retrograde,  in  an  orbit whose  plane  contained
almost  a right  angle  with  the  plane  of  the  ecliptic, and  whose  ascending
node  (by the computation  of  Dr. Halley)  was  in  ng 23°  23' ; the  inclina
tion  of  its orbit  to the  ecliptic 83°  11' ; its perihelion  in. n  25°  29' 30"
its perihelion  distance  from  the sun 56020  of such  parts  as the radius  of
the  orbis maguiis  contains  100000  ; and  the time  of  its perihelion  July
2'1. 3h. 50'.  And  the places  thereof, computed  by Dr. Halley  in  this  orbit,
are compared  with  the  places  of  the same  observed  by Mr.  Flamsted.  iD

   This  theory  is yet farther  confirmed  by the motion  of  that  retrograde+  0.20
comet  which  appeared  in the  year 1682.  The  ascending  node  of  this (by
Dr. Halleifs  computation)  was  in & 21°  16' 30" ; the inclination  of  its
orbit  to the plane  of  the  ecliptic 17°  56' 00"  ; its perihelion  in  «z, 2°  52'
50'' ; its perihelion  distance  from  the sun  5S32S  parts,  of which  the radius
of the  orbift matrnus  contains  100000  ; the  equal  time  of' the comet's
being  in  its perihelion  Sept.  4'1. 7h. 39'.  And  its  places, collected  from
Mr.  Flamsted's  observations,  are compared  with  its places computed  from
our  theory  in the following  table  :—

                                                 +++261617  From  these examples  it is abundantly  evident  that  the motions  of com
ets  are no  less accurately  represented  by our  theory  than  the motions                                               + 30 of the
planets commonly  are by the  theories  of them  ; and, therefore,  by means  of
this theory,  we may  enumerate  the  orbits  of comets,  and  so  discover  the

periodic  time  of  a  comet's  revolution  in  any  orbit ; whence,  at  last, we
shall have  the transverse  diameters  of  their  elliptic  orbits and  their aphe
lion  distances.

   That  retrograde  comet  which  appeared  in  the year  1607  described  an
orbit whose  ascending;  node  (according  to Dr. Halley's  computation)  was  in
 b  20° 2V  ; arid the inclination  of  the  plane  of  the  orbit  to the plane  of
the ecliptic  17°  2';, whose  perihelion  was  in  ox 2°  16'; and  its perihelion
distance  from  the sun  58680  of such  parts  as the radius  of the  orbis mag--
nns  contains  100000;  and  the comet  was  in  its perihelion  October  16(l. 3".
50' : which  orbit  agrees  very  nearly  with  the  orbit  of the comet  which  WHS
seen  in 1682.  If  these  were  not  two  cliiferent  comets,  but  one  and  the
same,  that comet  will  finish  one  revolution  in the  space  of  75  years  ; and
the greater  axis  of  its orbit  will  be to the greater  axis  of the nrbis magims

as  v/3   •' 75 X  75  to 1, or as 1778  to 100, nearly.  And  the  aphelion  dis
tance  of this comet  from  the  sun  will  be to the mean  distance  of  the  earth
from  the sun  as about  35  to 1 ; from  which  data  it will  be no hard  matter
to determine  the  elliptic orbit  of  this comet.  But  these  things  are  to be
supposed  on  condition,  that,  after  the  space  of 75  years,  the same  comet
shall  return  again  in the same  orbit.  The  other  comets  seem  to ascend  to
greater  heights, and  to require  a longer  time  to perform  their  revolutions.
   But.  because  of the great number  of comets,  of the great  distance  of their

aphelions  from  the  sun, and  of  the slowness  of  their  motions  in the aphe
lions, they  will, by their mutual  gravitations,  disturb  each  other ; so that
their  eccentricities  arid the times  of  their  revolutions  will  be sometimes  a
little increased, and  sometimes  diminished.  Therefore  we  are  not  to  ex
pect that  the same  comet  will return  exactly  in the same  orbit, and  in the
same  periodic  times : it will  be sufficient  if we  find  the changes  no  greater
than may  arise from  the causes  just spoken  of.
  And  hense  a  reason  may  be assigned why  comets  are  not comprehend-ed
within  the  limits  of  a zodiac,  as the planets  are;  but, being  confined  to no
bounds,  are  with  various  motions  dispersed  all over  the heavens;  namely,
to  this purpose,  that  in their  aphelions,  where  their motions  are exceedingly
slow, receding  to greater  distances  one  from  another,  they may  suffer  less
disturbance  from  their mutual  gravitations:  and  hence  it is that  the comets
which  descend  the lowest,  and  therefore  move  the slowest  in their  aphelions,
ought  also  to ascend  the highest.
  The  comet  which  appeared  in  the year  1GSO  was  in  its perihelion  less

distant  from  the sun  than  by  a sixth  part of  the  sun's diameter;  and  be
cause  of its extreme  velocity  in that proximity  to the  sun, and some  density
of the  sun's atmosphere,  it must  have  suffered  some  resistance  and  retarda
tion ; and  therefore,  being  attracted  something  nearer  to the  sun  in ev«ry
revolution,  will  at last fall down  upon  the body  of  the sun.  Nay.  in  its
aphelion,  where  it moves  the  slowest,  it may  sometimes  happen  to be yet
farther  retarded  by the attractions  of other  comets,  and  in consequence  of
this retardation  descend  to the sun.  So  fixed  stars, that have  been gradu
ally wasted  by the light and  vapours  emitted  from  them  for a long  time,
may  be recruited  by comets  that  fall upon  them  ; and  from  tlrs fresh sup
ply of new  fuel  those  old  stars, acquiring  new  splendor, may  pass  for new
stars.  Of  this  kind  are  such  fixed  stars  as appear  on  a sudden,  and  shine
with  a wonderful  brightness  at  first, and  afterwards  vanish  by  little and
little.  Such  was  that  star which  appeared  in Cassiopeia's  chair ; which
 Cornelius Gemma   did not  see upon  the  8th  of November,  1572, though
he was  observing  that  part of  the heavens  upon  that  very  night, and  the
sky  was  perfectly  serene;  but  the  next  night (November  9) he saw  it
shining much  brighter  than  any  of  the  fixed  stars, and  scarcely  inferior  to
 Venus  in splendor.  Tycho  Brake  saw  it upon  the llth  of the same  month,
when   it shone  with  the greatest  lustre;  and  from  that  time  he observed  it
to decay  by little and  little ; and  in  16  months'  time  it entirely  disap
peared.  In the month  of November,  when  it  first appeared,  its light was
equal  to that of Venus.  In the month  of December   its light was  a littie
diminished,  and  was  now  become  equal  to  that  of Jupiter.  In January
1573  it was  less than  Jupiter,  and  greater  than  Siriits ; and  about  the
end  of February  and  the  beginning  of March  became  equal  to that  star.
 In the months  of April  and May   it was  equal  to  a star  of the second  mag-

September,  October,  and  November,  to those  of  the  fourth  magnitude;  in
December  and January  1574  to those  of  the  fifth ; in February  to those
of the sixth magnitude;  and  in March   it entirely vanished.   Its colour  at
the beginning  was  clear, bright, and  inclining  to white;  afterwards  il
turned  a little yellow;  and  in March  1573  it became  ruddy,  like Mars   or
Alclebaran  : in May   it turned  to a kind  of dusky  whiteness,  like  that  we
observe  in Saturn  ; and  that  colour  it retained  ever  after, but growing  al
ways  more  and  more  obscure.  Such  also was  the  star  in the right  foot  oi

Serpentarius,  which  Kepler's  scholars  first observed  September  30, O.S.
1604, with  a light exceeding  that  of  Jupiter,  though  the  night  before  it
was  not  to be seen;  and  from  that  time  it decreased  by  little and  little,
and  in 15  or 16 months  entirely disappeared.  Such  a new  star appearing
with  an  unusual  splendor  is said  to have  moved  Hipparchus   to observe,
and make   a catalogue  of, the  fixed stars.  As  to those  fixed  stars  that  ap
pear  and  disappear  by  turns, and  increase  slowly  and  by  degrees,  and
scarcely  ever  exceed  the  stars  of  the  third  magnitude,  they seem  to be of
another  kind, which  revolve  about  their  axes,  and, having  a  light and  a
dark  side, shew  those  two  different  sides by turns.  The  vapours  which
arise from  the sun,  the  fixed  stars, and  the  tails of  the  comets, may  meet
at last with, and  fall into, the atmospheres  of the planets by their  gravity,
and  there  be condensed  and  turned  into water  and humid  spirits;  and from
thence, by  a slow  heat, pass gradually  into  the form  of  salts, and  sulphurs,
and  tinctures,  and  mud,  and  clay, and  sand, and  stones, and  coral, and  other
terrestrial  substances.

               GENERAL  SCHOLIUM.

  The  hypothesis  of vortices  is pressed  with many  difficulties.  That  every
planet  by a radius  drawn  to the  sun may  describe  areas  proportional  to the
times  of description,  the periodic  times  of  the several  parts  of the vortices
should  observe  the  duplicate  proportion  of  their  distances  from  the sun  ;
but  that  the periodic  times  of the planets may  obtain  the sesquiplicate  pro
portion  of their  distances  from  the  sun;  the periodic  times  of  the parts  of
the vortex  ought  to be  in the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  distances.
That  the smaller  vortices may  maintain  their  lesser  revolutions  about
Saturn,  Jupiter,  and  other  planets, and  swim  quietly  and  undisturbed  in
the greater  vortex  of  the  sun,  the periodic  times  of  the  parts of  the  sun's
 vortex  should  be equal ; but  the rotation  of the sun  and  planets  about  their
 axes, which  ought  to correspond  with  the motions  of  their  vortices,  recede
 far from  all these proportions.  The  motions  of the comets  are exceedingly
 regular,  are governed  by the same  laws  with  the  motions  of  the  planets,
 and  can by no means  be accounted  for by the hypothesis  of  vortices  ; for
 comets  are  carried  with  very  eccentric  motions  through  all parts  of  the

heavens  indifferently,  with  a freedom  that  is incompatible  with  the notion
of  a vortex.
   Bodies  projected  in our  air suffer  no  resistance  but from  the air.  With

draw  the  air, as is done  in Mr.  Boyle's  vacuum,  and  the resistance  ceases  ;
for in this void  a bit of  tine down  and  a piece of  solid gold descend  with
equal velocity.  Ajid  the parity  of reason  must  take  place  in the  celestial

spaces  above  the  earth's  atmosphere;  in which  spaces, where  there  is no
air  to resist  their motions,  all bodies  will move  with  the greatest freedom;
and  the planets  and  comets  will constantly  pursue  their revolutions  in  or
bits given  in kind  and  position, according  to the laws  above  explained ; but
though  these  bodies  may,  indeed, persevere  in their  orbits by the mere  laws
of gravity,  yet they could  by no  means  have  at  first derived  the regular
position  of the orbits  themselves  from  those  laws.
   The  six primary  planets  are  revolved  about  the sun  in circles concentric
with  the  sun, and  with  motions  directed  towards  the same  parts, and  al
most  in the same  plane.  Ten  moons  are revolved  about  the  earth, Jupiter
and  Saturn,  in  circles  concentric  with  them,  wi'h  the same  direction  of
motion,  and  nearly  in the planes  of  the  orbits  of those  planets ; but  it is
not  to be conceived  that  mere  mechanical  causes  could  give  birth  to  so
many  regular  motions,  since  the comets  range  over  all parts  of the heavens
in very  eccentric  orbits ; for by that kind  of motion  they  pass  easily through
the orbs  of the  planets, and  with  great  rapidity  ; and  in their  aphelions,
where  they move  the slowest,  and  are  detained  the longest, they  recede  to
the greatest  distances  from  each  other, and  thence  suffer  the  least disturb
ance from  their mutual  attractions.  This  most  beautiful  system  of the sun,
planets,  and  comets,  could  only proceed  from  the counsel  and dominion  of an
intelligent  and powerful  Being.  And  if the  fixed  stars  are  the centres  of oth
er like systems,  these, being formed  by the  like wise  counsel,  must  be  all sub
ject to the dominion  of One  ; especially  since  the light  of the  fixed  stars  is
of the same  nature  with  the light of the  sun,  and  from  every  system  light
passes  into  all the other  systems  : and  lest the  systems  of  the  fixed  stars
should, by their  gravity,  fall on  each  other  mutually,  he hath  placed  those
systems  at immense  distances  one from  another.
   This  Being  governs  all things, not  as the soul  of the world,  but  as Lord
over  all ; and  on  account  of his dominion  he  is wont  to be called Lord  God
-rra'TOKpaTup,  or Universal  Rider  ; for God  is a  relative  word,  and  has  a
respect  to servants  ; and  Deity  is the dominion  of God  not  over  his own
body,  as those imagine  who  fancy God  to be  the soul  of the world,  but  over
servants.  The  Supreme  God  is a Being  eternal,  infinite, absolutely  per
fect ; but  a being, however  perfect, without  dominion,  cannot  be said  to be
Lord  God ; for  we  say, my  God, your  God,  the God  of  Israel,  the God  of
Gods,  and  Lord  of  Lords ; but  we do  not  say, my  Eternal,  your  Eternal.

my  Perfect  : these  are  titles which  have  no  respect  to servants.  The  word

God*  usually  signifies Lord ; but every  lord  is not  a God.   It is the do
minion  of  a  spiritual  being which  constitutes  a God:  a true, supreme,  or
imaginary  dominion  makes  a true, supreme,  or imaginary God   And  from
his true dominion   it follows  that  the  true God   is a living,  intelligent,  and
powerful  Being ; and, from  his  other  perfections,  that  he  is supreme,   or
most  perfect.  He  is eternal  and  infinite, omnipotent  and omniscient  ; that
is, his duration  reaches  from  eternity  to eternity;  his presence  from  infinity
to infinity;  he governs  all things, and  knows  all things  that  are  or can  be
done.  He  is not  eternity  or  infinity, but  eternal  and  infinite;  he  is not
duration  or  space, but  he endures  and  is present.  He  endures  for  ever, and
is every  where  present  ; and  by existing always  and  every  where,  he consti
tutes duration  and  space.  Since  every  particle  of space  is always,  and
every  indivisible moment  of duration  is every  where,  certainly  the Maker
and Lord  of  all things  cannot  be never  and   'no where.  Every  soul  that
has perception  is, though  in different  times  and  in different  organs  of sense
and  motion,  still the same  indivisible  person.  There  are given  successive
parts  in duration,  co-existent  parts  in  space, but  neither  the  one  nor  the
other  in the person  of  a man,  or  his thinking  principle ; and  much  less
can  they  be found  in the thinking  substance  of God.  Every  man,  so far
as he  is a thing  that  has  perception,  is one  and  the  same  man  during  his
whole  life, in all and  each  of  his organs  of sense.  God  is the same  God,
always  and  every where.  He  is omnipresent  not  virtually  only, but  also
substantially  ; for virtue  cannot  subsist without  substance.  In himf  are
all things contained  and moved;  yet neither  affects  the other:  God  suffers
nothing  from  the motion  of bodies ; bodies  find  no  resistance  from  the om
nipresence  of God.   It  is allowed  by  all that  the Supreme  God  exists
necessarily  ; and  by the same  necessity  he  exists always  and  every  where.
Whence  also he  is all similar,  all  eye,  all ear,  all brain,  all arm,  all power
to perceive,  to understand,  and  to  act ; but  in  a manner  not  at all human,
in  a manner  not  at  all corporeal,  in a manner  utterly unknown   to us.  As
a blind  mail  has  no  idea  of  colours,  so have  we  no  idea of  the manner  by


   *  Dr. Pocock  derives  the  Latin word  Deus  from  the Arabic  du  (in the  oblique  case  tit).
which  signifies Lord.  And  in this  sense  princes  are  called  gods,  Psal.  Ixxxii.  ver.  6; and
John  x. ver. 35.  And  Moses  is called  a god  to his brother  Aaron,  and  a god  to Pharaoh,
(Exod.  iv. ver.  16  ; and  vii. ver. 1).  And  in the same  sense  the  souls  of dead  princes  were
 formerly,  by  the Heathens,  culled  gods,  but  falsely, because  of their want  of dominion.
   t  This  was  the  opinion  of  the Ancients.  So Pythagoras,  in Cicer.  de Nat.  Deor.  lib. i
 Thafes, Anaxagoras,  Virgil, Georg.  lib. iv. ver. 220;  and  ^Eneid,  lib.  vi. ver. 721.  Philo
 Allegor,  at the beginning  of  lib. i.  Aratu$,  in his Phaenom.   at the beginning.  So  also  the

 sacred  writers  ; as St. Paul,  Acts,  xvii. ver  27, 28.   St. John's  Gosp.  chap.  xiv.  ver. 2.  Mo
 tet, in Dent.  iv. ver. 39;  and  x  ver. 14.  David,  Psal.  cxxxix.  ver.  7, 8, 9.  Solomon,  1
 Kings,  viii. ver. 27.  Job,  xxii.  ver.  12, 13, 14.  Jeremiah,  xxiii.  ver.  23, 24.  The  Idolaters
 supposed  the  sun,  moon,  and  stars, the  souls  of men,  and  other  parts  of the world,  to be
 parts  of the Supreme  God,  and  therefore  to be worshipped  ; but  erroneously.

| minion of a spir | itual being whic | h constitu | tes a G | od: a true, su | preme, or |

| his true dominion | it follows that | the true G | od is a | living, intelli | gent, and |
| powerful Being ; | and, from his | other perf | ections, | that he is su | preme, or |
| most perfect. He | is eternal and | infinite, om | nipoten | t and omniscie | nt ; that |

| is every where pr | esent ; and by ex | isting alw | ays and | every where, | he consti |

which  the  all-wise God  perceives  and  understands  all things.  He  is ut
terly void  of  all body  and  bodily  figure, and  can  therefore  neither  l^e seen,
nor  heard,  nor  touched  ; nor  ought  he  to  be worshipped  under  the repre
sentation  of any  corporeal  thing. We  have  ideas  of  his attributes,  but
what  the  real substance  of any  thing  is we know  not.  In  bodies, we  see
only  their  figures and  colours, we  hear  only the sounds,  we  touch  only  their
outward  surfaces,  we  smell  only  the  smells, and  taste  the savours ; but  their
inward  substances  are  not  to be known  either by  our  senses, or by any
reflex  act of our  minds  : much   less, then, have  we  any  idea  of the  sub
stance  of God.  We  know  him  only by his most  wise  and  excellent  con
trivances  of  things, and  final causes  ; we  admire  him  for his  perfections ;
but  we  reverence  and  adore  him  on  account  of his dominion  : for we  adore

him  as  his  servants  ; and  a god  without  dominion,  providence,  and  final
causes,  is nothing  else but Fate  and  Nature.  Blind  metaphysical  neces
sity, which  is certainly  the same  always  and  every  where,  could  produce
no  variety  of things.  All  that  diversity  of natural  things  which  we  find
suited  to different  times  and  places could  arise from  nothing  but  the  ideas
and  will  of a Being  necessarily  existing.  But, by way  of  allegory, God
is said  to see,  to speak,  to laugh,  to love, to  hate,  to desire,  to  give,  to  re
ceive,  to rejoice, to  be angry,  to  fight, to frame,  to work,  to build ; for  all
our  notions  of God  are taken  from  the ways  of mankind  by  a certain
similitude,  which, though  not  perfect, has  some  likeness, however.  And
thus much  concerning  God  ; to discourse  of whom  from  the appearances
of  things,  does  certainly  belong  to Natural  Philosophy.
   Hitherto  we  have  explained  the phenomena  of  the heavens  and  of  our
sea by the power  of gravity,  but  have  not  yet  assigned  the cause  of  this
power.  This  is certain,  that  it must  proceed  from  a cause  that  penetrates

'to the  very  centres  of the  sun  and  planets, without  suffering  the  least
diminution  of  its force;  that  operates  not  according  to the quantity  of
the surfaces  of  the  particles upon  which   it acts  (as mechanical  causes  use
 to do), but according  to the quantity  of  the solid  matter  which  they  con
 tain,, and  propagates  its virtue  on  all sides  to immense  distances,  decreasing
always  in the duplicate  proportion  of  the distances.  Gravitation  towards
 the sun  is made  up out  of  the  gravitations  towards  the several  particles
 of which  the body  of  the sun  is composed  ; and  in receding  from  the sun
 decreases  accurately  in the duplicate  proportion  of  the  distances  MS far  as
 the orb of Saturn,  as evidently  appears  from  the quiescence  of  the aphe
 lions  of the planets  ; nay, and  even  to the remotest  aphelions  of the comets,
 if those  aphelions  are  also quiescent.  But  hitherto  I have  not  been  able
 to discover  the cause  of those  properties  of gravity  from  phenomena,  and
 I frame  no hypotheses  ; for whatever  is not deduced  from  the phenomena
 is to be  called  an  hypothesis  ; and  hypotheses,  whether  metaphysical   01
 physical, whether  of occult  qualities  or mechanical,  have  no  place  in ex

perimental  philosophy.  In  this philosophy  particular  propositions  are
inferred  from  the phenomena,  and  afterwards  rendered  general  by induc
tion.  Thus   it was  that  the impenetrability,  the mobility,  and  the impul
sive  force  of  bodies, and  the  laws  of  motion  and  of  gravitation,  were
discovered.  And  to us  it is enough  that  gravity  does  really  exist, and  act
according  to the laws  which  we  have  explained,  and  abundantly  serves  to
account  for  all the motions  of  the  celestial  bodies, and  of  our  sea.
  And  now  we might  add  something  concerning  a  certain  most  subtle
Spirit which  pervades  and  lies hid in  all gross  bodies ; by the  force  and
action  of which  Spirit  the  particles  of bodies  mutually  attract  one  another
at near  distances,  and  cohere,  if contiguous  ; and  electric  bodies  operate  to
greater  distances,  as  well  repelling  as attracting  the neighbouring  corpus
cles ; and  light  is emitted,  reflected,  refracted,  inflected, and  heats  bodies  ;
and  all sensation  is excited, and  the members  of animal  bodies  move  at the
command   of the  will, namely,  by the vibrations  of  this  Spirit, mutually
propagated  along  the solid  filaments  of  the  nerves, from  the outward  or
gans  of sense  to the  brain, and from  the brain  into  the muscles.  But  these
are things  that  cannot  be  explained  in few  words,  nor  are we  furnished
with  that  sufficiency  of experiments  which  is required  to an  accurate  deter
mination  and  demonstration  of  the laws by which  this  electric  and  elastic
Spirit  operates.

                               THF

   SYSTEM     OF   THE   WORLD





     It. was  the ancient  opinion  of  not  a few, in the  earliest  ages  of  philoso
phy, that  the fixed  stars  stood immoveable  in the highest  parts  of the world  ;
that, under  the  fixed  stars  the  planets  were  carried  about  the  sun  ; that  the
earth,  us  one  of the planets,  described  an annual  course  about  the  sun, while
by a diurnal  motion  it was  in the mean  time  revolved  about  its own  axis;
and  that  the  sun,  as  the common   fire which  served  to warm  the  whole,  was
fixed  in the  centre  of the  universe.

  This  was  the  philosophy  taught  of  old by Philolans,  Aristarchus  of
Santos,  Plato  in his riper  years,  and  the whole  sect  of the Pythagoreans   ;
and  this was  the judgment  of Anaximander,  more  ancient  than  any  of
them  ; and  of  that  wise  Iring of  the Rovnans, Numa  Pompilins,  who,  as
a symbol  of  the  figure  of  the world  with  the sun  in the  centre,  erected  a
temple  in honour  of  Vesta,  of  .% i^und  form, and  ordained  perpetual  fire to
be kept  in the middle  of  it.
  The  Egyptians  were  early  observers  of  the  heavens  ; and  from  them.,
probably,  this philosophy  was  spread  abroad  among  other  nations  ; for from
them  it was, and  the  nations  about  them,  that  the Greeks,  a  people  of
themselves  more  addicted  to the study  of philology  than  of nature,  derived
their  first, as  well  as  soundest,  notions  of philosophy  ; and  in the  vestal
ceremonies  we  may  yet trace  the  ancient  spirit of  the Egyptians  ; for  it
was  their way  to deliver  their  mysteries,  that  is, their philosophy  of things
above  the vulgar  way  of  thinking,  under  the  veil  of  religious  rites  and
hieroglyphic  symbols.
   It is not  to be  denied  but  that Anaxa&oras,  Democritus,  and  others,
did now  and  then  start  up, who  would  have  it that  the  earth  possessed  the
centre  of  the world,  and  that  the  stars of  all  sorts  were  revolved  towards
the  west  about  the  earth  quiescent  in  tk^  centre, some  at  a swifter,  others
at  a slower  rate.

   However,  it was  agreed  on both  sides  that  the  motions  of  the  celestial
bodies  were  performed  in spaces  altogether  free and  void  of resistance.  The
whim  of solid  orbs  was  of a later  date, introduced  by Eudoxus,  Calippus,
and  Aristotle;  when  the ancient  philosophy  began  to decline, and  to give
nlace  to the new  prevailing  fictions  of the Greeks.
   But.  above  all things,  the phenomena   of comets  can by no  means  consist

with  the notion  of solid orbs.  The  Chaldeans,  the most  learned  astrono
mers  of  their  time,  looked  upon  the comets  (which  of ancient  times  before
had  been numbered  among  the  celestial  bodies)  as  a particular  sort  of plan
ets, which,  describing  very  eccentric  orbits, presented  themselves  to our view
only by turns,  viz., once  in  a  revolution, when  they  descended  into  the
lower  parts  of their  orbits.
  And  as it was  the unavoidable  consequence  of  the  hypothesis  of  solid
orbs, while  it prevailed,  that  the comets  should  be thrust  down  below  the
moon,  so  no  sooner  had  the  late observations  of astronomers  restored  the
comets   to their  ancient  places  in the higher  heavens,  but  these  celestial  spaces
were  at once  cleared  of  the  incurnbrance  of  solid  orbs, which  by these  ob
servations  were  broke  into  pieces, and  discarded  for  ever.
  Whence   it was  that  the  planets  came  to be retained  within  any  certain
bounds  in these  free  spaces,  and  to be drawn  off from  the  rectilinear  courses,
which,  left  to themselves,  they  should  have  pursued,  into  regular  revolu
tions  in curvilinear  orbits, are  questions  which  we  do  not know  how  the
ancients  explained  ; and  probably  it was  to give some  sort  of  satisfaction
to this  difficulty  that  solid  orbs were  introduced.
  The  later philosophers  pretend  to account  for  it either  by the action  of
certain  vortices,  as Kepler  and Des  Cartes  ;  or by some  other  principle  of
impulse  or  attraction,  as Borelli, Honke,  and  others  of  our  nation  ; for,
from  the laws  of motion,  it  is most  certain  that  these  effects must  proceed
from  the action  of some  force  or  other.
   But  our  purpose  is only  to trace  out  the quantity  and  properties  of this
force from  the phenomena   (p. 218), and  to apply what  we  discover  in some
simple  cases  as principles, by which,  in  a mathematical  way,  we may  esti
mate  the  effects  thereof  in more  involved  cases  : for  it would  be endless  and
impossible  to bring  every  particular  to direct  and  immediate  observation.
  We  said, in  a mathematical  way,  to avoid  all questions  about  the  na
ture  or quality  of  this  force, which  we  would  not  be understood  to deter
mine  by any hypothesis;  and  therefore  call  it by the  general name  of  a
centripetal  force,  as  it is a  force which  is directed  towards  some  centre ;
and  as  it regards  more  particularly  a body  in that  centre,  we  call  it circum
solar, circum-terrestrial,  circum-jovial  ; and  in  like manner  in  respect  of
other  central  bodies.
   That  by means  of  centripetal  forces  the planets may  be retained  in cer
tain  orbits, we may  easily understand,  if we  consider  the  motions  of  pro
jectiles  (p. 75, 76, 77) ; for  a stone  projected  is by the  pressure  of  its own
weight  forced  out  of the  rectilinear  path, which  by the projection  alone  it
should  have  pursued,  and made  to describe  a  curve  line  in  the  air ; and
through  that crooked  way  is at last brought  down  to the ground  ; and  the
greater  the velocity  is with  which  it is projected,  the  farther  it goes  before
it falls  to the earth.  We  may  therefore  suppose  the  velocity  to be so in

| only by turns, viz. | , onc | e in a revo | lution, when | they descende | d into the |
| lower parts of their | orbi | ts. |  |  |  |
| And as it was t | he un | avoidable c | onsequence of | the hypothes | is of solid |
| orbs, while it preva | iled, | that the com | ets should be | thrust down | below the |
| moon, so no sooner | had | the late ob | servations of | astronomers r | estored the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comets to their anci | ent p | laces in the h | igher heavens, | but these cele | stial spaces |
| were at once cleare | d of | the incurnb | rance of solid | orbs, which b | y these ob |
| servations were bro | ke i | nto pieces, an | d discarded fo | r ever. |  |
| Whence it was | that | the planets | came to be ret | ained within | any certain |

| which, left to thems | elves | , they shou | ld have pursu | ed, into regu | lar revolu |

| ancients explained | ; and | probably it | was to give s | ome sort of | satisfaction |
| to this difficulty t | hat so | lid orbs wer | e introduced. |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| But our purpose | is o | nly to trace | out the quantit | y and proper | ties of this |

the curve  lines which  a body would  describe,  if projected  in an horizontal

more  velocity  (p. 400) ; and, because  the  celestial motions  are  scarcely  re
tarded  by the  little  or no  resistance  of  the  spaces  in which  they  are  per
formed,  to keep up  the parity  of  cases, let us  suppose  either  that  there  is
no  air about  the  earth,  or  at least  that  it is endowed  with  little  or  no power

   But  if we  now  imagine  bodies  to be  projected  in  the directions  of  lines
parallel  to the horizon  from  greater  heights,  as of 5, 10, 100, 1000,  or more
miles,  or rather  as many  semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  those  bodies,  accord
ing  to their  different  velocity, and  the  different  force  of gravity  in different
heights,  will  describe  arcs  either  concentric  with  the  earth,  or variously
eccentric,  and  go on  revolving  through  the  heavens  in those  trajectories,
just as the planets  do  in their  orbs.
   As when   a stone  is projected  obliquely,  that  is, any way  but  in the  per
pendicular  direction,  the  perpetual  deflection  thereof  towards  the  earth
from  the right  line  in which  it was  projected  is a proof  of  its gravitation
to the  earth, no  less certain  than  its direct  descent when  only  suffered  to
fall freely from  rest ; so  the deviation  of bodies moving  in free spaces from
rectilinear  paths, and  perpetual  deflection  therefrom  towards  any  place,  is
a sure  indication  of  the  existence  of some  force which  from  all quarters
impels  those  bodies  towards  that  place.
   And  as, from  the  supposed  existence  of  gravity,  it necessarily  follows
that  all bodies  about  the earth must  press downwards,  and  therefore  must
either  descend  directly  to  the  earth,  if they  are  let  fall from  rest,  or  at
least perpetually  deviate  from  right  lines towards  the  earth,  if they  arc
projected  obliquely  ; so from  the supposed  existence  of  a force  directed  to
any  centre,  it will  follow, by  the  like  necessity,  that  all bodies  upon  which
this force  acts mast  either descend  directly  to that  centre,  or  at least  devi
ate perpetually  towards  it from  right  lines, if otherwise  they should  have
moved  obliquely  in these  right  lines.
   And  how  from  the motions  given we  may  infer  the  forces, or from  the
forces given  we may  determine  the motions,  is shewn  in the two  first Books
of our Principles  of Philosophy.
   If  the earth  is supposed  to stand  still, and  the  fixed  stars  to be revolved
 in free spaces  in the  space  of 24  hours,  it is certain  the  forces by which
the  fixed  stars  are  retained  in their  orbs  are not  directed  to the  earth, but
 to the  centres  of  the several  orbs, that  is, of  the several  parallel  circles,
which  the  fixed  stars, declining  to one  side and  the other  from  the equator,
describe  daily  ; also that  by radii drawn  to the centres  of  those  orbs  tht
fixed  stars  describe  areas  exactly  proportional  to  the times  of  description.
Then,  because  the periodic  times  are equal  (by Cor.  Ill, Prop.  IV, Book   1),
 it follows  that  the centripetal  forces  are  as  the  radii  of the  several  orbs,
 and  that  they  will  perpetually  revolve  in  the same  orbs.  And  the  like
consequences  may  be drawn  from  the supposed  diurnal  motion  of  the

 planets.
   That  forces  should  be directed  to no body  on which  they physically  de
pend, but  to innumerable  imaginary  points  in the  axis  of  the earth,  is an
 hypothesis  too incongruous.  It is more  incongruous  still that  those  forces
should  increase  exactly  in proportion  of  the distances  from  this  axis ; for

| But if we no | w im | agine bodies to | be projected | in the | directio | ns of lines |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| parallel to the | horiz | on from greater | heights, as o | f 5, 10, | 100, 10 | 00, or more |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| miles, or rather | as m | any semi-diame | ters of the | earth, t | hose bod | ies, accord |
| ing to their dif | ferent | velocity, and | the different f | orce of | gravity | in different |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| heights, will de | scrib | e arcs either | concentric wi | th the | earth, o | r variously |
| eccentric, and g | o on | revolving thr | ough the he | avens i | n those | trajectories, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| just as the plan | ets d | o in their orbs. |  |  |  |  |
| As when a st | one i | s projected obl | iquely, that | is, a ny | way but | in the per |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| pendicular dire | ction | , the perpetua | l deflection | thereof | towards | the earth |
| from the right | line | in which it was | projected is | a proof | of its | gravitation |
| to the earth, no | less | certain than i | ts direct des | cent wh | en only | suffered to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| fall freely from | rest | ; so the deviati | on of bodies | moving | in free | spaces from |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rectilinear paths | , and | perpetual de | flection there | from to | wards a | ny place, is |
| a sure indicatio | n of | the existence | of some for | ce which | from | all quarters |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| impels those bo | dies | towards that pl | ace. |  |  |  |
| And as, from | the | supposed exis | tence of gra | vity, it | necessar | ily follows |
| that all bodies | about | the earth mus | t press down | wards, | and the | refore must |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| either descend | direct | ly to the eart | h, if they a | re let f | all from | rest, or at |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| least perpetuall | y dev | iate from righ | t lines towa | rds the | earth, | if they arc |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| projected obliqu | ely ; | so from the s | upposed exist | ence of | a force | directed to |
| any centre, it w | ill f | ollow, by the li | ke necessity, | that all | bodies | upon which |
| this force acts m | ast | either descend | directly to t | hat centr | e, or at | least devi |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ate perpetually | towa | rds it from ri | ght lines, if o | therwise | they | should have |
| moved obliquely | in | these right line | s. |  |  |  |
| And how fro | m the | motions give | n we may in | fer the | forces, | or from the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| forces given we | may | determine the | motions, is sh | ewn in | the two | first Books |
| of our Principl | es o | f Philosophy. |  |  |  |  |
| If the earth | is su | pposed to stand | still, and th | e fixed | stars to | be revolved |
| in free spaces i | n the | space of 24 | hours, it is c | ertain | the force | s by which |
| the fixed stars | are r | etained in their | orbs are not | directe | d to th | e earth, but |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| to the centres | of t | he several orbs, | that is, of | the seve | ral para | llel circles, |
| which the fixed | stars | , declining to | one side and | the othe | r from | the equator, |
| describe daily ; | also | that by radii | drawn to the | centres | of tho | se orbs tht |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| fixed stars desc | ribe | areas exactly p | roportional | to the t | imes of | description. |
| Then, because | the p | eriodic times a | re equal (by | Cor. Ill, | Prop. I | V, Book 1), |
| it follows that | the c | entripetal force | s are as the | radii o | f the s | everal orbs, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and that they | will | perpetually re | volve in the | same | orbs. A | nd the like |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| consequences m | ay | be drawn from | the suppos | ed diur | nal mot | ion of the |

| That forces | shoul | d be directed | to no body on | which | they phy | sically de |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| pend, but to in | numer | able imaginar | y points in | the axis | of the | earth, is an |
| hypothesis too | inco | ngruous. It is | more incongr | uous sti | ll that | those forces |
| should increase | exac | tly in proporti | on of the di | stances | from thi | s axis ; f or |

this  is an  indi  ation  of  an increase  to immensity,  or  rather  to  infinity  ;
whereas  the  forces  of natural  things commonly  decrease  in receding  from
the  fountain  from  which  they flow.  But, what  is yet more  absurd,  neither
are  the  areas  described  by  the same  star proportional  to the  times,  nor  are
its revolutions  performed  in the same  orb ; for  as the  star  recedes  from  the
neighbouring  pole, both  areas  and  orb increase;  and  from  the increase  of
the  urea  it is demonstrated  that the  forces  are  not  directed  to the axis  of

the earth.  And   this  difficulty  (Cor.  1, Prop.  II) arises from  the  twofold
motion  that  is observed  in the  fixed  stars, one  diurnal  round  the axis  of
the  earth,  the other  exceedingly  slow  round  the axis  of  the ecliptic. And
the explication  thereof  requires  a composition  of  forces  so  perplexed  and
so variable,  that  it is hardly  to be reconciled  with  any  physical  theory.
  That  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  to  the  bodies  of  the
sun,  of  the  earth, and  other  planets,  I thus  infer.
  The  moon  revolves  about  our  earth, and  by radii drawn  to  its centre
(p. 390)  describes  areas  nearly  proportional  to the times  in which  they  are
described,  as  is evident  from  its velocity compared  with  its apparent  diame
ter ; for  its motion  is slower  when  its diameter  is  less (and therefore  its
distance  greater), and  its motion  is swifter  when  its diameter  is greater.
  The  revolutions  of  the  satellites  of Jupiter  about  that  planet  are  more
regular  (p. 386)  : for they  describe  circles  concentric  with  Jupiter  by equa
ble motions,  as exactly  as  our  senses  can  distinguish.
  And  so the  satellites  of Saturn  are  revolved  about  this planet  with  mo
tions nearly  (p. 387)  circular  and  equable,  scarcely  disturbed  by any  eccen
tricity hitherto  observed.
   That  Venus  and Mercury  are  revolved  about  the sun,  is demonstrable

from  their  moon-like  appearances  (p. 388)  . when  they  shine  with  a  full
face, they  are  in those  parts  of  their  orbs which  in respect  of the earth  lie
beyond  the  sun  ; when  they appear  half  full, they  are  in those  parts  whicli
Ire over  against  the  sun  ; when  horned,  in  those  parts which   lie between

the earth  and  the  sun  ; and  sometimes  they  pass  over  the  sun's  disk, when
directly  interposed  between  the  eirth  and  the  sun.
   And  Venus,  with  a motion  almost  uniform,  describes  an  orb nearly  cir
cular  and  concentric  with  the  sun.

   But  Mercury,  with  a more  eccentric  motion,  makes  remarkable  ap
proaches  to the sun,  and  goes  off again by turns ; but  it is always  swifter
 as it is near  to the  sun, and  therefore  by a  radius  drawn  to the sun  still
 describes  areas  proportional  to the  times.
   Lastly,  that  the  earth  describes  about  the  sun,  or  the  sun  about  the
 earth, by  a radius  from  the one  to the  other,  areas  exactly  proportional  to
 the times,  is demonstrable  from  the  apparent  diameter  of  the  sun  com
 pared  with  its apparent  motion.
   These  are astronomical  experiments  ; from  which  it follows, by Prop.  I,

11, III, in the  first Book  of our Pn  /triples, and  their  Corollaries  (p.
213,  214).  that  there  are  centripetal  forces  actually  directed  (either  accu
rately  or  without  considerable  error)  to the  centres  of  the  earth, of Jupi
ter, of  S.iturn, and  of  the sun.  In  Mercury,  Venus,  Mars, and  the  lesser
planets, wheie  experiments  are wanting,  the arguments  from  analogy  must
be allowed  in their  place.
  That  those  forces  (p. 212,  213, 214)  decrease  in  the  duplicate  propor
tion  of  the distances  from  the  centre  of every  planet, appears  by Cor.  VI,
Prop.  IV, Book   1 ; for the periodic  times  of  the  satellites  of Jupiter  are
one  to  another  (p. 386, 387) in  the  sesquiplicate  proportion  of  their  dis
tances  from  the  centre  of this  planet.
  This  proportion  has  been  long ago  observed  in those  satellites  ; and  Mr.
Flamsted,  who  had  often  measured  their  distances  from  Jupiter by the
micrometer,  and  by the  eclipses  of  the  satellites, wrote  to me,  that  it holds
to  all the accuracy  that  possibly  can  be discerned  by our  senses.  And  he
sent me  the dimensions  of their  orbits  taken  by the micrometer,  a*nd  re
duced  to the mean  distance  of Jupiter  from  the  earth, or from  the sun,
together  with  the times  of  their  revolutions,  as follows  :—

   And  the periodic  times  of those  satellites,  by the  observations  of  Mr.

 Flamsted,  are  ld. 18h. 28' 36"  | 3(l. 13". 17'  54"  | 7(1. 3h. 59' 36"  | 16".
 IS11. 5' 13".  as  above.
   And  the distances  thence  computed  are 5,578  | 8,878  | 14,168  | 24,968,
accurately  agreeing  with  the distances  by observation.
   Cassini  assures  us  (p. 388, 389)  that  the same  proportion  is observed
in the  circum-saturnal  planets.  But  a  longer  course  of observations  is
required  before  we  can have  a certain  and  accurate  theory  of those  planets.
   In  the  circum -solar  planets, Mercury  and  Venus,  the  same  proportion
holds  with  great  accuracy,  according  to  the dimensions  of  their  orbs,  as
determined  by the observations  of the  best astronomers.
   That  Mars  is revolved  about  the sun  is demonstrated  from  the phases
which  it shews,  and  the proportion  of  its apparent  diameters  (p. 388, 389,
and  390) ; for from  its appearing  fall near  conjunction  with  the  sun, and
gibbous  in its quadratures,  it is certain  that  it surrounds  the  sun.
   And  since  its diameter  appears  about  five  times  greater when  in opposi
tion  to the sun  than  when  in conjunction  therewith,  and  its distance  from
the  earth  is reciprocally  as its apparent  diameter,  that  distance  will  be
about  five times  less when  in  opposition  to than  when  in conjunction  with
the sun;  but  in both  cases  its distance  from  the sun  will  be  nearly  about
the same  with  the  distance  which  is inferred  from  its gibbous  appearance
in the quadratures.  And  as  it encompasses  the  sun  at almost  equal  dist  n-
ces, but  in respect  of  the earth  is very  unequally  distant,  so by radii drawn
to the  sun  it describes  areas  nearly  uniform  ; but by radii drawn  to  the
earth,  it is sometimes  swift, sometimes  stationary,  and sometimes  retrograde.
  That  Jupiter,  in a higher  orb than  Mars,  is likewise  revolved  about  the
sun,  with  a motion  nearly  equable,  as well  in distance  as in the  areas  des
cribed,  1 infer  thus.
   Mr. Flamsted  assured  me, by  letters, that  all  the  eclipses of  the inner
most  satellite which  hitherto  have  been  well  observed  do  agree  with  his
theory  so  nearly,  as  never  to  differ therefrom  by two  minutes  of time  ;
that  in the outmost  the  error  is little  greater  ; in  the  outmost  but  one,
scarcely  three  times  greater ; that  in  the innermost  but  one  the  difference
is indeed  much  greater,  yet  so  as to agree  as nearly  with  his computation?
as the moon  does  with  the common   tables  ; and  that  he computes  those
eclipses only from  the mean  motions  corrected  by the equation  of  light  dis
covered  and  introduced  by Mr. Rower.  Supposing,  then, that  the theory

differs by a less error  than  that  of  2' from  the motion  of  the outmost  sat
ellite as hitherto  described,  and  taking  as the periodic  time  16'1. 18h.  5' 13"
to 2  in time,  so is the whole  circle  or 360°  to the  arc  1' 48",  the  error  ol
Mr.  Flamsted's  computation,  reduced  to  the  satellite's  orbit, will  be  less
than  1' 48"  ; that  is, the longitude  of  the  satellite,  as seen from  tlie centre
of Jupiter;  will  be determined  with  a  less error than  1' 48".  But  when

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| In the circ | um -solar plan | ets, Mercu | ry | and Venus, | the sam | e proportion |
| holds with gre | at accuracy, | according | to | the dimensi | ons of | their orbs, as |

 the  satellite  is in the middle  of  the shadow,  that  longitude  is the same  with
 the heliocentric  longitude  of Jupiter  ; and,  therefore,  the hypothesis  which
 Mr. Flamsted  follows,  viz., the Copernican,  as improved  by Kepler,  and
 fas to the motion  of Jupiter)  lately corrected  by himself,  rightly  represents
 that longitude  within  a less error  than  1' 48" ; but by  this  longitude,  to
 gether  with  the geocentric  longitude,  which  is always  easily found,  the dis
 tance  of Jupiter  from  the sun  is determined  ; which  must,  therefore,  be  the
 very  same  with  that which  the hypothesis  exhibits.  For  that  greatest  error

 of  I' 48"  that can  happen  in  the heliocentric  longitude  is almost  insensi
 ble, and  quite  to be neglected,  and  perhaps may  arise from  some  yet undis
covered  eccentricity  of the  satellite : but  since  both  longitude  and  distance
 are  rightly  determined,  it follows  of necessity  that  Jupiter, by radii drawn
 to the sun.  describes  areas  so conditioned  as  the hypothesis  requires,  that  is.
proportional  to the  times.
   And  the same  thing may  be concluded  of Saturn  from  his  satellite, by
the observations  of  Mr. Huygens  and  Dr. Halley  ; though  a longer  series
of observations  is yet wanting  to confirm  the thing,  and  to bring  it under
a sufficiently  exact  computation.
   For  if Jupiter was  viewed  from  the  sun,  it would  never  appear  retro
grade  nor  stationary,  as  it is seen  sometimes  from  the  earth, but always  to
go forward  with  a  motion  nearly uniform  (p. 389).  And  from  the  very
great  inequality  of  its apparent  geocentric  motion, we  infer  (by Prop.  Ill
Cor. IV)  that  the force by which  Jupiter  is turned  out of  a rectilinear  course,
and made   to revolve  in an  orb,  is not  directed  to the centre  of the  earth.
And  the same  argument  holds good  in Mars  and  in Saturn.  Another  centre
of  these  forces  is therefore  to be looked  for  (by Prop.  II and  III, and  the
Corollaries  of the  latter), about  which  the  areas  described  by radii  inter
vening  may  be equable  ; and  that  this  is the  sun, we  have  proved  already
in Mars  and  Saturn  nearly,  but  accurately  enough  in Jupiter.  It may  be
alledged  that  the sun  and  planets  are impelled  by some  other  force equally
and  in the direction  of parallel  lines ; but  by such  a force  (by Cor. VI  of
the Laws  of Motion)  no  change  would  happen  in  the  situation  of  the
planets one  to another,  nor  any  sensible  eifect follow  : but our  business  is
with  the  causes  of sensible  effects.  Let  us,  therefore,  neglect  every  such
force  as imaginary  and  precarious,  and  of  no  use  in the phenomena   of the
heavens  ; and  the whole  remaining  force  by which  Jupiter  is impelled  will
be directed  (by Prop.  Ill, Cor.  I) to the centre  of  the sun.
  The  distances  of  the planets from  the  sun  come  out  the same,  whether,
with  Tycho,  we  place  the  earth  in the centre  of the system,  or the  sun  with
Copernicus  : and  we have  already  proved  that  these  distances  are  true  ir.

   Kepler  and  Bullialdiis  have,  with  great  care  (p. 388), determined  the
listances  of the  planets from  the  sun  ; and  hence  it is that  their  table.-?

| For if Jupiter wa | s viewed fro | m the sun, | it would | never | appe | ar retro |

 agree  best with  the heavens.  And  in all the planets,  in Jupiter  and  Mars,
 in Saturn  and  the  earth,  as well  as in Venus  and  Mercury,  the  cubes  of their
 distances  are  as the squares  of  their  periodic  times  ; and  therefore  (by Cor.
 VI, Prop. IV)  the centripetal  circum-solar  force throughout  all the plane
 tary regions  decreases  in the duplicate  proportion  of the  distances  from  the
sun.  In examining  this proportion,  we  are  to  use  the  mean  distances,  or
 the transverse  semi-axes  of  the  orbits  (by Prop. XV).  arid  to neglect  those
 little fractions,  which,  in denning  the  orbits, may  have  arisen  from  the  in
sensible  errors  of observation,  or may  be ascribed  to other  causes  which  we
shall afterwards  explain.  And  thus  we  shall  always  find  the said propor
tion  to hold  exactly;  for the distances  of Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  the Earth,
Venus,  and  Mercury,  from  the  sun, drawn  from  the  observations  of  as
tronomers,  are, according  to  the computation  of Kepler,  as  the numbers
95 LOGO, 519650,  152350,  100000,  72400, 3S806;  by the computation  of
/iHllialdus,  as the numbers  95419S,  522520,  152350,  100000,  72393,
38585  ; and from  the periodic  times  they come  out 953806,  520116,  152399,
 100000,  72333, 38710.  Their  distances,  according  to  Kepler  and
Ktillwldus,  scarcely  differ by  any  sensible  quantity,  and  where  they
differ most  the distances  drawn  from  the periodic  times,  fall in between  them.
   That  the circum-terrestrial  force  likewise  decreases  in the duplicate  pro
portion  of  the  distances,  I infer  thus.
   The  mean  distance  of the moon  from  the  centre  of  the earth,  is, in semi-
diameters  of  the  earth, according  to Ptolemy,  Kepler  in his Ephemerides,
Bidliuldus,  Hevelius,  and  Ricciolns,  59 ; according  to Flamsted,  59|  ;
according  to Tycho,  56 1 ; to Vendelin,  60  ; to Copernicus,  60 1 : to Kir-
cher, 62i  (p. 391, 392,  393).
  Cut  Tycho,  and  all that  follow  his  tables  of refraction, making  the
refractions  of  the sun  and  moon  (altogether  against  the  nature  of  light)
to exceed  those  of  the  fixed  stars, and  that by about  four  or  five minutes
in the  horizon,  did thereby augment  the  horizontal  parallax  of  the moon
by about  the  like number  of minutes  ; that  is, by about  the  12th  or 15th
part  of the whole  parallax.  Correct  this  error, and  the distance  will  be
come  60  or 61  semi-diameters  of the  earth, nearly  agreeing  with  what
others  have  determined.

   Let  us, then, assume  the mean  distance  of  the moon  60 semi-diameters
of  the  earth, and  its periodic  time  in respect  of the  fixed  stars  27d.  7h. 43',
as astronomers  have  determined  it. And  (by Cor.  VI, Prop.  IV) a body
revolved  in  our  air, near  the  surface  of the  earth  supposed  at  rest, by
means  of  a centripetal  force  which  should  be  to the same  force  at the  dis
tance  of  the moon  in the reciprocal  duplicate  proportion  of  the distances
from  the  centre  of the  earth,  that  is, as 3600  to 1, would  (secluding  the
resistance  of  the  air) complete  a revolution  in  lh. 24'  27".

| tion to hold exac | tly; for the distan | ces of Saturn | , Jupiter, M | ars, the Earth, |

| differ most the di | stances drawn from | the periodic | times, fall i | n between them. |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| That the circu | m-terrestrial force | likewise dec | reases in the | duplicate pro |
| portion of the di | stances, I infer th | us. |  |  |
| The mean dist | ance of the moon | from the cent | re of the ea | rth, is, i n semi- |
| diameters of the | earth, according t | o Ptolemy, K | epler in his | Ephemerides, |
| Bidliuldus, Hev | elius, and Riccio | lns, 59 ; ac | cording to F | lamsted, 59| ; |

| refractions of th | e sun and moon | (altogether a | gainst the n | ature of light) |

has been  determined  by the  late mensuration  of  the French  (vide p. 406) ;
then  the sume  body, deprived  of  its circular  motion,  and  falling by the
impulse  of  the same  centripetal  force  as before, would,  in  one  second  of
time,  describe  15-^  Paris   feet.
   This  we  infer by  a calculus  formed  upon  Prop. XXXYI,  and  it agrees
with  what  we  observe  in all bodies  about  the  earth.  For  by the  experi
ments  of pendulums,  and  a computation  raised  thereon,  Mr. Hnygens  has
demonstrated  that  bodies  falling by all that  centripetal  force  with  which
(of whatever  nature  it  is) they  are impelled  near  the surface  of the  earth,
do, in one  second  of  time, describe  15T^  Paris  feet.
   But  if the earth  is supposed  to  move,  the earth  and moon  together  (by
Cor.  IV  of  the Laws  of Motion,  and  Prop. LVID  will  be revolved  about

their common   centre  of gravity.  Ana  the moon  (by Prop. LX)  will  in

the same  periodic  time,  27'1. 7h. 43', with  the same  circum  terrestrial  force
diminished  in the duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance,  describe  an  orbit
whose  semi-diameter  is to the semi-diameter  of the former  orbit, that  is, to
60 semi-diameters  of  the  earth,  as the sum  of both  the bodies  of the  earth
and  moon  to the  first of two  mean  proportionals  between  this sum  and  the
body  of the  earth  ; that  is, if we  suppose  the moon  (on account  of  its

mean  apparent  diameter  31^')  to be  about ^  of  the  earth, as 43  to

 ^  42  a- 43|2,  or  as about  128  to 127.  And  therefore  the semi-diameter
of  the  orbit, that  is, the distance  between  the  centres  of the moon  and
earth,  will  in this  case be 60^ semi-diameters  of the  earth, almost  the same
with  that  assigned by Copernicus,  which  the Tychonic  observations  by no
means  disprove  ; and,  therefore,  the duplicate  proportion  of  the decrement
of  the  force holds  good  in  this distance.  I have  neglected  the increment
of  the  orbit which  arises from  the  action  of  the  sun  as inconsiderable  ;
but  if that  is subducted,  the  true  distance  will remain  about  60|- semi-
diameters  of the  earth.
   But  farther  (p. 390) ; this proportion  of the decrement  of the forces  is
confirmed  from  the  eccentricity  of the  planets, and  the very  slow motion
 of  their  apses ; for  (by the  Corollaries  of Prop. XLV)   in no  other  pro-
 portion  could  the circum-solar  planets  once in  every  revolution  descend  to
 their  least and  once  ascend  to their  greatest  distance  from  the sun, and  the
 places of  those  distances  remain  immoveable.  A  small  error from  the du
 plicate proportion  would  produce  a  motion  of the  apses  considerable  in
 every  revolution,  but  in many  enormous.
   But  now,  after innumerable  revolutions,  hardly  any  such motion  ha&
 been  perceived  in  the  orbs of  the circum-solar  planets.  Some  astronomers
 affirm  that  there  is no  such motion;  others  reckon  it no  greater  than what
 may  easily  arise from  the causes  hereafter  to be assigned,  and  is of  no mo«
 ment  in the present  question.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| then the sum | e body, | deprived of | its circ | ula | r motion, and f | alling by the |

| This we in | fer by a | calculus form | ed upo | n | Prop. XXXYI, | and it agrees |
| with what we | observe | in all bodies | about | th | e earth. For | by the experi |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| demonstrated | that bod | ies falling by | all t | hat | centripetal forc | e with which |
| (of whatever | nature i | t is) they are | impell | ed | near the surface | of the earth, |
| do, in one sec | ond of t | ime, describe | 15T^ P | ari | s feet. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| But if the | earth is | supposed to | move, | the | earth and moon | together (by |
| Cor. IV of th | e Laws | of Motion, an | d Prop | . | LVID will be re | volved about |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| their common | centre | of gravity. | Ana | the | moon (by Prop. | LX) will in |

| the same peri | odic time | , 27'1. 7h. 43', | with | the | same circum te | rrestrial force |
| diminished in | the dup | licate propor | tion o | f t | he distance, des | cribe an orbit |
| whose semi-di | ameter | is to the semi- | diamete | r | of the former or | bit, that is, to |
| 60 semi-diame | ters of | the earth, as | the sum | o | f both the bodie | s of the earth |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and moon to | the first | of two mean | proport | ion | als between thi | s sum and the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| body of the | earth ; t | hat is, if we | suppos | e t | he moon (on a | ccount of its |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ^ 42 a- 43|2 | , or as a | bout 128 to | 127. | And | therefore the | semi-diameter |
| of the orbit, | that is, | the distance | between | t | he centres of t | he moon and |
| earth, will in | this case | be 60^ semi- | diamete | rs | of the earth, al | most the same |

   We  may  even  neglect  the motion  of the moon's  apsis (p. 390,  391), which
 is far  greater  than  in the circum-solar  planets, amounting  in every  revolu
 tion  to three  degrees ; and  from  this motion  it is demonstrable  that  the
circum-terrestrial  force  decreases  in no  less than  the duplicate,  but  far  less
than  the triplicate  proportion  of  the distance ; for  if the duplicate  propor
tion  was  gradually  changed  into  the  triplicate, the  motion  of the  apsis
would  thereby  increase  to  infinity;  and,  therefore,  by  a very  small  muta
 tion, would  exceed  the motion  of the moon's  apsis.  This  slow  motion  arises
from  the action  of the circum-solar  force,  as we  shall afterwards  explain.
 But, secluding  this cause,  the  apsis or  apogeon  of  the moon  will  be  fixed,
and  the duplicate  proportion  of  the decrease  of the circum-terrestrial  force
 in different  distances  from  the  earth  will accurately  take  place.
  Now  that  this proportion  has  been  established,  we  may  compare  the
forces  of the  several  planets among  themselves  (p. 391).
   In the mean  distance  of Jupiter  from  the earth,  the greatest  elongation

of  the outmost  satellite from  Jupiter's  centre  (by the observations  of Mr.
Flamsted]  is 8' 13" ; and  therefore  the distance  of  the  satellite from  the
centre  of Jupiter  is to the mean  distance  of Jupiter  from  tne  centre  of the
sun  as 124  to 52012,  but  to the mean  distance  of Venus  from  the  centre

of  the  sun  as  124  to 7234;  and  their periodic  times  are  16£d. and 224fd  ;
and from  hence  (according  to Cor.  II, Prop.  IV), dividing  the distances  by
the squares  of the  times, we  infer  that  the  force  by which  the  satellite  is
impelled  towards  Jupiter  is to  the  force by which  Venus  is impelled  to
wards  the sun  as 442  to 143  ; and  if we  diminish  the  force by which  the
satellite  is impelled  in  the  duplicate  proportion  of the  distance  124  to
7234,  we  shall have  the circum-jovial  force  in the distance  of Venus  from
the sun  to  the circum-solar  force  by which  Venus  is impelled  as yW   to
143,  or  as  1  to 1100;  wherefore  at equal  distances  the circum-solar  force
is 1100  times  greater  than  the circum-jovial.
   And,  by the  like computation,  from  the periodic  time  of  the  satellite  ot
Saturn   15(l. 22h. and  its greatest  elongation  from  Saturn,  while  that planet
is in  its mean  distance  from  us, 3' 20",  it follows  that  the  distance  of  this
satellite from  Saturn's  centre  is to the distance  of Venus  from  the sun  as
92|  to 7234;  and  from  thence  that  the absolute  circum-solar  force  is 2360
times  greater  than  the absolute  circum-saturnal.
  From  the regularity  of the  heliocentric  and  irregularity  of  the geocen
tric motions  of Venus,  of  Jupiter, and  the other  planets,  it is evident  (by
Cor.  IV, Prop.  Ill) that  the circum-terrestrial  force, compared  with  the cir
cum-solar,  is very  small.
   Ricciolus  and  Vendelin  have  severally  tried  to determine  the  sun's  par
allax from  the moon's  dichotomies  observed  by  the telescope, and  they  agree
that  it does  not  exceed  half  a minute.

| We may even n | eglect the motion | of the moon' | s apsis (p. 3 | 90, 3 | 91), which |
| is far greater than | in the circum-so | lar planets, | amounting i | n eve | ry revolu |
| tion to three degre | es ; and from thi | s motion it | is demonst | rable | that the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| circum-terrestrial | force decreases in | no less than | the duplica | te, b | ut far less |
| than the triplicate | proportion of th | e distance ; | f or if the du | plica | te propor |
| tion was gradually | changed into | the triplicate | , the motio | n of | the apsis |
| would thereby incr | ease to infinity; | and, theref | ore, by a ve | ry sm | all muta |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tion, would exceed | the motion of the | moon's aps | is. This slo | w mot | ion arises |
| from the action of | the circum-solar | force, as w | e shall afte | rward | s explain. |
| But, secluding this | cause, the apsis | or apogeon | of the moon | wil | l be fixed, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and the duplicate | proportion of the | decrease of | the circum-te | rrest | rial force |
| in different distanc | es from the earth | will accurat | ely take pla | ce. |  |
| Now that this | proportion has | been establis | hed, we ma | y co | mpare the |
| forces of the several | planets among | themselves ( | p. 391). |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the outmost sate | llite from Jupite | r's centre | (by the obser | vatio | ns of Mr. |

| and from hence (a | ccording to Cor. | II, Prop. IV) | , dividing t | he di | stances by |

| is 1100 times grea | ter than the circ | um-jovial. |  |  |  |
| And, by the like | computation, fr | om the perio | dic time of | the s | atellite ot |

| Saturn 15(l. 22h. an | d its greatest elo | ngation from | Saturn, wh | ile t | hat planet |

| 92| to 7234; and | from thence that | the absolute | circum-solar | for | ce is 2360 |

| From the regula | rity of the helio | centric and | irregularity | of th | e geocen |

 Mars  insensible,  even  in opposition  to the  sun, when  that parallax  is some
 thing greater  than  the sun's.
   Flamsted  attempted  the same  parallax  with  the micrometer  in the  peri-
geon  position of  Mars,  but  never  found  it above  25" ; and  thence  conclud
 ed the  sun's  parallax  at most  10".
   Whence  it follows  that  the distance  of the moon  from  the  earth  bears
 no  greater  proportion  to the distance  of  the  earth  from  the sun  than  29  to
 IOUOO  : nor  to the distance  of Venus  from  the sun  than  29  to 7233.
  From  which  distances,  together  with  the periodic  times, by the method
above  explained,  it is easy  to infer that  the  absolute  circum-soiar  force  is
greater  than  the absolute  circum-terrestrial  force  at least 229400  times.
  And  though  we  were  only  certain, from  the  observations  of Ricciolus

and  Vcitdelin,  that  the  sun's  parallax  was  less than  half  a minute,  yet from
this  it will follow  that  the absolute  circum-solar  force  exceeds  the absolute
circum-terrestrial  force S500  times.
  By  the  like computations  I happened  to discover  an  analogy,  that  is ob
served  between  the  forces  and  the bodies  of the  planets ; but, before  I  ex
plain  this  analogy,  the  apparent  diameters  of  the planets  in their mean
distances  from  the  earth must  be  first determined.
   Mr. Flamsted   (p. 387), by the  micrometer,  measured  the  diameter  of

Jupiter 40"  or 41";  the diameter  of Saturn's  ring  50"  ; and  the diameter
of  the  sun  about  32'  13"  (p. 387).
   But  the diameter  of Saturn  is to the diameter  of the ring, according  to
Mr. Huygens  and  Dr. Halley,  as 4 to 9; according  to  Gullet-ins,  as 4  to
10;  and  according  to Hooke  (by a telescope  of  60  feet), as 5 to 12.  And
from  the mean  proportion,  5 to 12, the  diameter  of Saturn's  body  is in
ferred  about  21".
   Such  as we  have  said  are  the apparent  magnitudes;  but. because  of  the
unequal  refrano-ibility  of light,  all lucid  points  are  dilated  by  the  tele
scope,  and  in the focus  of  the  object-glass  possess  a  circular  space  whose
breadth  is about  the 50th  part  of  the aperture  of  the  glass.
   It is true, that  towards  the circumference  the  light  is Su  rare  as hardly
to move  the  sense  ; but towards  the middle,  where  it  is of greater  density,
and  is sensible  enough,  it makes   a small  lucid  circle, whose  breadth  varies
according  to the splendor  of  the lucid  point,  but  is generally  about  the 3d,
or 4th,  or 5th  part  of the breadth  of  the whole.
  Let ABD   represent  the  circle  of  the whole  light; PQ  the  small  circle
of  the denser  and  clearer  light; C  the  centre  of both;  CA,  CB,  semi-di
ameters  of  the greater  circle containing  a  right angle  at C ; ACBE   the

| Mr. Huygens and | Dr. | Halley, as 4 | to 9; accordin | g to Gullet | -ins | , as 4 to |

| from the mean pr | oport | ion, 5 to 12, | the diameter | of Saturn's | bo | dy is in |

| Such as we have | said | are the appar | ent magnitude | s; but. bec | aus | e of the |

density  of  the  light in any  place  P, will, by my  computation,  be  as the
line FG,  and  therefore  at the  centre  infinite, but  near  the circumference
very small.  And  the  whole  light within  the  small  circle PQ,  is to the
      without  as the  area  of  the quadrilateral  figure CAKP   to the  trian-





gle PKB.  And  we  are  to understand  the  small  circle  PQ,  to  te  there
terminated,  where  FG,  the density  of  the  light, begins  to be less than what
 is required  to move  the  sense.
   Hence  it was,  that,  at the distance  of 191 382  feet, a fire of 3 feet in di

ameter,  through  a  telescope  of 3  feet, appeared  to Mr.  Picart  of  S"  in
breadth,  when  it should  have  appeared  only of  3"  14'"  ; and  hence  it is
that  the brighter  fixed  stars appear  through  the telescope  as of 5"  or 6" in
diameter,  and  that  with  a good  full  light ; but with  a  fainter  light  they
appear  to run  out  to  a greater breadth.  Hence,  likewise,  it was  that He-
 velius, by diminishing  the aperture  of the  telescope,  did  cut  off a great  part
 of the light towards  the circumference,  and  brought  the  disk  of the  star  to
 be more  distinctly  defined, which,  though  hereby  diminished,  did  yet ap
 pear  as  of 5" or 6"  in diameter.  But  Mr.  Hvyg'etis,  only by clouding  the
 eye-glass  with  a  little smoke,  did  so  effectually  extinguish  this scattered
 light, that  the  fixed  stars  appeared  as mere  points, void  of  all  sensible
 breadth.  Hence  also  it was  that  Mr. Huygens,  from  the breadth  of bodies
 interposed  to intercept  the whole  light  of the  planets, reckoned  their diam

scattered  light, which  could  not  be seen  before  for the stronger  light  of the
planet, when  the planet  is hid, appears  every  way  farther spread.  Lastly,
from  hence  it is that  the planets  appear  so  small  in the  disk  of  the  sun,
being  lessened  by the dilated  light.  For  to Hevelius,  Galletius,  and  Dr.

Halley,  Mercury  did  not seem  to exceed  12"  or 15"  ; and  Venus  appeared
to Mr.  Crabtrie  only  1' 3;/ ; to Horrox  but  1' 12" ; though  by the men
surations  of Hevelius  and Hu&enius  without  the  sun's  disk, it ought  to
have  been  seen  at least  1' 24".  Thus  the apparent  diameter  of  the moon,
which  in 1 684,  a few  days  both  before  and  after  the  sun's  eclipse, was
measured  at the observatory  of Paris  31' 30",  in the  eclipse  itself  did  not
seem  to exceed  30  or 30' 05"  ; and  therefore  the diameters  of  the planets
are  to be diminished  when  without  the  sun,  and  to be augmented  when
within  it, by some  seconds.  But  the  errors  seem  to be  less than  usual  in
the mensurations  that  are made  by the micrometer.  So from  the diameter
of  the shadow,  determined  by the  eclipses of  the  satellites, Mr. Flamsted

found  that  the semi- diameter  of Jupiter  was  to  the greatest  elongation  of
the outmost  satellite  as 1 to 24,903.  Wherefore  since  that  elongation  is

8'  13'', the diameter  of Jupiter  will  be 39^-" ; and, rejecting  the  scattered
light,  the diameter  found  by the micrometer  40"  or 41"  will  be reduced  to
39|-"  5 and  the diameter  of Saturn  21"  is to be diminished  by the  like  cor
rection, and  to be reckoned  20",  or something  less.  But  (if I am  not  mis
taken)  the diameter  of the  sun, because  of  its stronger  light,  is to be dimin

ished something  more,  and  to be reckoned  about  32', or 32'  61'.
   That  bodies  so different  in magnitude  should  come  so near  to an analogy
with  their  forces,  is not  without  some  mystery  (p. 400).
   It may  be that  the remoter  planets,  for want  of heat, have  not  those me
tallic substances  and  ponderous  minerals  with  which  our  earth  abounds  ;
and  that  the bodies  of Venus  and  Mercury,  as they  are more  exposed  to the

sun's  heat,  are  also harder  baked,  and  more  compact.
   For, from  the experiment  of the  burning-glass,  we  see that  the heat  in
creases  with  the density  of light ; and  this density  increases  in the recipro
cal duplicate  proportion  of  the  distance  from  the  sun ; from  whence  the

san's  heat  in Mercury  is proved  to be  sevenfold  its heat  in our summer
seasons.  But  with  this heat  our  water  boils  ; and  those  heavy  fluids, quick
silver and  the  spirit of  vitriol, gently  evaporate,  as I have  tried by  the
thermometer  ; and  therefore  there  can  be no  fluids  in Mercury  but what
are heavy,  and  able  to bear  a great  heat, and  from  which  substances  of great
density may  be nourished.
   And  why  not, if God  has  placed  different  bodies  at different  distances
from  the  sun,  so  as the denser  bodies  always  possess  the nearer  places, and
 each  body  enjoys  a degree  of heat  suitable  to its condition,  and  proper  for
 its nourishment?  From  this  consideration  it will  best appear  that  the
weights  of all the planets  are  one  to another  as their  forces.

| from hence it is t | hat t | he planets | appear so s | mall in the di | sk of | the sun, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| being lessened by | the | dilated lig | ht. For to | Hevelius, Galle | tius, | and Dr. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Halley, Mercury | did n | ot seem to | exceed 12" | or 15" ; and V | enus | appeared |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| to Mr. Crabtrie | only | 1' 3;/ ; t o H | orrox but | 1' 12" ; thoug | h by | the men |
| surations of Heve | lius | and Hu&en | ius withou | t the sun's dis | k, it | ought to |
| have been seen at | least | 1' 24". | Thus the ap | parent diameter | of | the moon, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| which in 1 684, a | few | days both | before and | after the sun | 's ec | lipse, was |
| measured at the | observ | atory of P | aris 31' 30" | , in the eclipse | itse | lf did not |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| seem to exceed 30 | or | 30' 05" ; an | d therefore | the diameters | of t | he planets |
| are to be diminish | ed w | hen witho | ut the sun, | and to be au | gment | ed when |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| within it, by some | sec | onds. But | the errors | seem to be less | than | usual in |
| the mensurations | that | are made b | y the micro | meter. So from | the | diameter |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the shadow, d | eterm | ined by th | e eclipses of | the satellites, | Mr. | Flamsted |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| found that the se | mi- di | ameter of | Jupiter was | to the greatest | elo | ngation of |
| the outmost satel | lite a | s 1 to 24,9 | 03. Wheref | ore since that | elo | ngation is |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8' 13'', the diamet | er o | f Jupiter w | ill be 39^-" | ; and, rejecting | the | scattered |
| light, the diamete | r fou | nd by the | micrometer | 40" or 41" will | be | reduced to |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ished something | more, | and to be | reckoned ab | out 32', or 32' | 61'. |  |
| That bodies so | diffe | rent in mag | nitude shou | ld come so near | to a | n analogy |
| with their forces, | is no | t without | some myster | y (p. 400). |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| It may be that | the | remoter pla | nets, for wan | t of heat, have | not | those me |
| tallic substances | and | ponderous | minerals wi | th which our | earth | abounds |
| and that the bodi | es of | Venus and | Mercury, as | they are more | expo | sed to the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun's heat, are al | so har | der baked, | and more c | ompact. |  |  |
| For, from the | exper | iment of t | he burning-g | lass, we see th | at th | e heat in |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| san's heat in Mer | cury | is proved | to be seven | fold its heat | in ou | r summer |
| seasons. But wit | h this | heat our | water boils ; | a nd those heavy | flui | ds, quick |

| density may be n | ourish | ed. |  |  |  |  |
| And why not, | if Go | d has pla | ced different | bodies at diff | erent | distances |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| each body enjoys | a deg | ree of hea | t suitable t | o its condition, | and | proper for |
| its nourishment | ? Fr | om this c | onsideration | it will best a | ppear | that the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| weights of all the | plan | ets are one | to another | as their forces. |  |  |

   But  I should  be glad  the diameters  of  the planets  were  more  accurately
measured  ; and  that may  be done,  if a lamp,  set at  a great  distance,  is made
to shine  through  a circular  hole, and  both  the  hole  and  the  light of  the
lamp  are  so diminished  that  the spectrum  may  appear  through  the telescope
just like  the planet, and may  be  defined  by  the same  measure  : then  the
diameter  of  the hole  will  be  to its distance  from  the  objective  glass  as  the
true diameter  of the planet  to its distance  from us.  The  light  of the lamp
may  be  diminished  by  the  interposition  either  of  pieces  of  cloth,  or  of
smoked  glass.
   Of  kin  to  the analogy  we  have  been  describing,  there  is another  observed
between  the  forces  and  the  bodies  attracted  (p. 395,  396, 397).  Since  the
action  of  the  centripetal  force upon  the planets  decreases  in the duplicate

proportion  of the  distance,  and  the periodic  time  increases  in the sesquipli-
cate  thereof,  it is evident  that  the  actions  of  the  centripetal  force, and
therefore  the periodic  times, would  be equal  in equal  planets  at equal  dis
tances  from  the sun  ; and  in equal  distances  of unequal  planets  the  total
actions  of  the  centripetal  force would  be  as the  bodies  of the planets ; for
if the actions  were  not proportional  to the  bodies  to be moved,  they could
not  equally  retract  these  bodies  from  the  tangents  of  their  orbs  in equal
times  : nor  could  the motions  of the  satellites  of Jupiter  be  so regular,  if it
was  not  that  the circum-solar  force was  equally  exerted  upon  Jupiter  and
all its satellites  in proportion  of their  several weights.  And  the same  thing
is to be said of Saturn  in  respect  of  its satellites, and  of  our  earth  in  re
spect of  the moon,  as  appears  from  Cor.  II and  III, Prop. LXV.   Arid,
therefore,  at equal  distances,  the actions  of  the  centripetal  force  are  equal
upon  all the planets  in proportion  of  their  bodies,  or of  the  quantities  of
matter  in  their  several  bodies;  and  for the same  reason  must  be the same
upon  all the  particles  of the same  size  of which  the planet  is composed  ; for
if the action  was  greater  upon  some  sort  of particles  than  upon  others  than
in proportion  to their quantity  of  matter,  it would  be  also greater  or  less
upon  the whole  planets  not  in proportion  to  the  quantity  only, but  like
wise  of the  sort  of the matter  more  copiously  found  in one  and  more
sparingly  in another.
   In such  bodies  as  are found  on  our  earth  of very  different  sorts, I exam
ined  this analogy  with  great  accuracy  (p. 343,  344).
   If the  action  of  the circum-terrestrial  force  is proportional  to the bodies
to be moved,  it will  (by the Second  Law  of Motion)  move  them  with  equal
velocity  in equal  times, and  will make  all bodies  let fall to descend  through
equal  spaces  in equal  times, and  all bodies hung  by equal  threads  to vibrate
in equal times.  If the  action  of  the  force was  greater,  the times  would  be
less ; if that was  less, these would  be greater.
   But  it has been  long  ago  observed  by others,  that (allowance  being made
for the small  resistance  of  the  air) all bodies  descend  through  equal  spaces

| just like the | planet, and ma | y be defin | ed by the | same mea | sure | : then the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| true diameter | of the planet | to its distan | ce from u | s. The l | ight of | the lamp |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| may be dimi | nished by the | interposit | ion either | of pieces | of c | loth, or of |
| smoked glass. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Of kin to | the analogy we | have been | describing, | there is a | nother | observed |
| between the | forces and the | bodies attr | acted (p. 3 | 95, 396, 3 | 97). | Since the |
| action of the | centripetal fo | rce upon t | he planets | decreases | in the | duplicate |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| proportion of | the distance, | and the peri | odic time | increases | in the | sesquipli- |
| cate thereof, | it is evident | that the a | ctions of | the centri | petal | force, and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| therefore the | periodic times, | would be | equal in e | qual plane | ts at | equal dis |
| tances from | the sun ; and i | n equal dist | ances of u | nequal p | lanets | the total |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| actions of th | e centripetal f | orce would | be as the | bodies of | the pl | anets ; f or |
| if the actions | were not prop | ortional to | the bodies | to be mo | ved, | they could |
| not equally r | etract these bo | dies from | the tangen | ts of the | ir orb | s in equal |
| times : nor c | ould the motion | s of the sat | ellites of | Jupiter be | so re | gular, if it |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| was not that | the circum-sol | ar force wa | s equally | exerted u | pon J | upiter and |
| all its satellit | es in proportio | n of their s | everal weig | hts. And | the | same thing |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| spect of the | moon, as appe | ars from | Cor. II and | III, Prop | . LX | V. Arid, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| therefore, at | equal distances, | the action | s of the c | entripetal | force | are equal |
| upon all the | planets in prop | ortion of t | heir bodies | , or of t | he qua | ntities of |
| matter in the | ir several bodi | es; and for | the same | reason m | ust be | the same |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| upon all the | particles of the | same size | of which th | e planet | is comp | osed ; f or |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| if the action | was greater up | on some sor | t of particl | es than u | pon o | thers than |
| in proportion | to their quant | ity of matt | er, it wou | ld be als | o grea | ter or less |

in equal  times  ; and, by the help  of pendulums,  that  equality  of tim-es may
be distinguished  to great  exactness.
   1 tried  the  thing  in  gold,  silver,  lead,  glass, sand, common  salt wood,
water,  and wheat.  I provided  two  equal wooden  boxes.  I filled the  one
with  wood,  and suspended  an  equal weight  of gold  (as exactly  as I could)
in the centre  of oscillation  of the other.  The  boxes, hung  by equal  threads
of  11  feet, made  a couple  of pendulums  perfectly  equal  in weight  and  fig
ure, and  equally  exposed  to the resistance  of  the  air : and, placing  the  one
by the other,  I observed  them  to play  together  forwards  and  backwards  for
a long while, with  equal  vibrations.  And  therefore  (by Cor.  1 and  VI,
Prop. XXIV.  Book  II) the quantity  of matter  in the gold was  to the quan
tity of  matter  in the wood  as the action  of  the motive  force upon  all the
gold  to the action  of the same  upon  all the wood  ; that  is, as the weight  of
the one  to the weight  of the  other.
  And  by these experiments,  in bodies  of the same  weight,  could  have  dis
covered  a difference  of matter  less than  the thousandth  part  of the  whole.
   Since  the action  of  the centripetal  force upon  the  bodies  attracted  is, at
equal  distances,  proportional  to  the  quantities  of matter  in  those  bodies,
reason  requires  that  it should  be  also proportional  to the quantity  of mat
ter in the body  attracting.
   For  all action  is mutual,  and  (p. 83, 93. by the Third  Law  of Motion)
makes  the bodies  mutually  to approach  one  to the  other, and  therefore  must
be the same  in both  bodies.  It is true  that  we  may  consider  one body  as
attracting,  another  as attracted;  but  this distinction  is more  mathematical
than natural.  The  attraction  is really common  of  either  to  other, and
therefore  of  the same  kind  in both.
  And  hence  it is that  the  attractive  force  is found  in both.  The  sun  at
tracts Jupiter  and  the  other  planets ; Jupiter  attracts  its  satellites  ; and,
for the same  reason,  the  satellites  act  as well  one  upon  another  as upon Ju
piter, and  all the planets mutually  one  upon  another.
   And  though  the mutual  actions  of two  planets may  be  distinguished
and  considered  as two, by which  each  attracts  the  other,  yet, as those  ac
tions are  intermediate,  they do  not make  two  but  one  operation  between
two terms.  Two  bodies may  be mutually  attracted  each  to the other by
the contraction  of  a cord interposed.  There  is a  double  cause  of  action,
 to wit, the disposition  of both  bodies,  as  well  as  a double  action  in so far
as the  action  is considered  as upon  two  bodies ; but  as betwixt  two  bodies
it is but  one  single one.  It  is not  one  action  by which  the  sun  attracts
Jupiter,  and  another  by which  Jupiter  attracts  the  sun  ; but  it is one  ac
tion by which  the sun  and  Jupiter  mutually  endeavour  to approach  each
the other.  By  the  action  with  which  the  sun  attracts  Jupiter,  Jupiter  and
the sun  endeavours  to come  nearer  together  (by the Third  Law  of Mo
 tion) ; and  by the  action  with  which  Jupiter  attracts  the  sun, likewise  Ju-

| 1 t ried t | he thin | g in g | old, silver, l | ead, glass, sa | nd, common | salt wood, |
| water, and | wheat. | I pro | vided two e | qual wooden | boxes. I | filled the one |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| with wood, | and su | spended | an equal we | ight of gold | (as exactl | y as I could) |
| in the centr | e of osc | illation | of the other | . The boxes, | hung by | equal threads |
| of 11 feet, | made a | couple | of pendulum | s perfectly e | qual in we | ight and fig |
| ure, and eq | ually ex | posed | to the resista | nce of the ai | r : and, pl | acing the one |
| by the other | , I obs | erved t | hem to play | together forw | ards and b | ackwards for |
| a long whil | e, with | equal | vibrations. | And therefo | re (by Co | r. 1 and VI, |
| Prop. XXIV | . Book | II) the | quantity of | matter in th | e gold was | to the quan |
| tity of mat | ter in | the wood | as the acti | on of the mo | tive force | upon all the |
| gold to the | action | of the | same upon al | l the wood ; | that is, a s | the weight of |
| the one to | the weig | ht of | the other. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| And by | these ex | periment | s, in bodies | of the same | weight, co | uld have dis |
| covered a d | ifference | of mat | ter less than | the thousan | dth part o | f the whole. |
| Since the | action | of the | centripetal | force upon th | e bodies a | ttracted is, at |
| equal distan | ces, pr | oportion | al to the q | uantities of | matter in | those bodies, |
| reason requi | res tha | t it sho | uld be also | proportional | to the quan | tity of mat |
| ter in the b | ody att | racting. |  |  |  |  |
| For all a | ction i | s mutual | , and (p. 8 3, | 93. by the | Third Law | of Motion) |
| makes the | bodies m | utually | to approach | one to the o | ther, and t | herefore must |
| be the same | in bot | h bodie | s. It is tr | ue that we ma | y consider | one body as |
| attracting, | another | as attr | acted; but t | his distinctio | n is more | mathematical |
| than natur | al. Th | e attra | ction is rea | lly common | of either | to other, and |
| therefore of | the sa | me kin | d in both. |  |  |  |
| And henc | e it is | that the | attractive | force is found | in both. | The sun at |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tracts Jupit | er and | the oth | er planets ; | J upiter attr | acts its sa | tellites ; and, |
| for the same | reason | , the s | atellites act a | s well one up | on another | as upon Ju |
| piter, and a | ll the p | lanets | mutually one | upon anothe | r. |  |
| And tho | ugh the | mutua | l actions of | two planets | may be | distinguished |
| and conside | red as | two, by | which each | attracts the | other, yet, | as those ac |
| tions are i | ntermedi | ate, th | ey do not m | ake two but | one opera | tion between |
| two terms. | Two | bodies | may be mutu | ally attracte | d each to | the other by |
| the contract | ion of | a cord | interposed. | There is a | double cau | se of action, |
| to wit, the | disposit | ion of | both bodies, | as well as a | double ac | tion in so far |
| as the actio | n is co | nsidered | as upon tw | o bodies ; b u | t as betwix | t two bodies |

attracted  towards  Jupiter  by a twofold  action, nor  Jupiter  by a  twofold
action  towards  the  sun  ; but  it is one  single intermediate  action, by which
both  approach  nearer  together.

other iron.  But  the action  betwixt  the load-stone  and  iron  is single, and
is considered  as single by the  philosophers.  The  action  of  iron upon  the
load-stone,  is, indeed,  the action  of the  load-stone  betwixt  itself and  the
iron, by which  both  endeavour  to come  nearer  together  : and  so  it mani
festly appears  ; for  if you  remove  the  load-stone,  the whole  force  of  the
iron  almost  ceases.

   Tn this  sense  it is that  we  are  to conceive  one  single  action  to be  ex
erted betwixt  two  planets,  arising from  the  conspiring  natures  of  both   :
and  this action standing  in the same  relation  to both,  if it is proportional
to the quantity  of matter  in the  one, it will  be also proportional  to the
quantity  of matter  in the  other.
   Perhaps  it may  be objected,  that, according  to this philosophy  (p. 39S),
all bodies  should  mutually  attract  one  another,  contrary  to  the  evidence
of experiments  in terrestrial  bodies ; but  I answer,  that  the experiments  in
terrestrial  bodies come  to no  account ; for the  attraction  of homogeneous
spheres  near  their  surfaces  are (by Prop. LXXII)  as  their  diameters.
Whence   a sphere  of one  foot  in diameter,  and  of a  like nature  to  the
earth, would  attract  a  small  body  placed  near  its surface  with  a force
20UOOOOO  times  less than  the earth  would  do  if placed  near  its surface;
but  so small  a force could  produce  no  sensible  effect.  If two  such  spheres
were  distant  but by 1 of an  inch, they would  not, even  in spaces void  of

| load-stone, | is, inde | ed, the | action of | the load-s | tone | betwixt i | tself and the |

| iron almost | ceases. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Tn this | sense it | is that | we are to | conceive | one s | ingle act | ion to be ex |
| erted betwi | xt two | planets, | arising f | rom the c | onspir | ing natu | res of both |
| and this ac | tion sta | nding i | n the same | relation t | o both, | if it is | proportional |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Perhaps | it may | be obje | cted, that, | according | to this | philoso | phy (p. 39S), |

resistance, come  together  by the  force  of  their mutual  attraction  in  less

than  a month's  time  j and  less spheres  will come  together  at  a rate  yet
slower,  viz.. in the proportion  of  their diameters.  Nay, whole  mountains
will  not be  sufficient  to produce  any  sensible  effect.  A mountain  of  an
hemispherical  figure, three  miles  high, and  six  broad,  will  not, by its  at
traction, draw  the pendulum  two  minutes  out  of  the  true perpendicular  :
and  it is only  in the great  bodies  of the planets  that  these  forces  are  to be
perceived,  unless  we  may  reason  about  smaller  bodies  in manner  following.
   Let ABCD   (p. 93) represent  the  globe  of the  earth  cut by any  plane
AC  into two  parts ACB,  and  A CD.  The  part ACB  bearing  upon  the
part ACD   presses  it with  its whole  weight;  nor  can  the part ACD   sustain
this  pressure  and  continue  unmoved,  if it is not  opposed  by an  equal  con
trary pressure.  And  therefore  the  parts  equally  press  each  other by their
weights,  that  is, equally  attract  each  other, according  to the  third Law  of
Motion  ; and,  if separated  and  let go, would  fall towards  each  other  with
velocities  reciprocally  as the bodies.  All which  we  may  try and  see in the
load-stone,  whose  attracted  part does  not propel  the part  attracting,  but  is
only stopped  and  sustained  thereby.

   Suppose  now  that ACB  represents  some  small  body  on  the  earth's  sur
face  : then, because  the mutual  attractions  of this  particle, and  of  the  re
maining  part ACD   of the  earth  towards  each  other,  are  equal, but  the
attraction  of  the  particle towards  the  earth  (or  its weight)  is as the matter
of  the  particle  (as we  have  proved  by the  experiment  of  the pendulums),
the  attraction  of the  earth  towards  the  particle  will  likewise  be  as the
matter  of the  particle ; and  therefore  the  attractive  forces  of  all  terres
trial bodies  will  be  as their  several  quantities  of matter.
   The  forces  (p. 396), which  are  as the  matter  in terrestrial  bodies  of  all
forms,  and  therefore  are  not mutable  with  the  forms, must  be found  in  all
sorts  of bodies  whatsoever,  celestial  as  well  as  terrestrial, and  be  in  all
proportional  to  their  quantities  of  matter,  because  among   all there  is no
difference  of substance,  but  of modes  and  forms  only.  But  in  the  celes
tial bodies  the same  thing  is likewise  proved thus. We  have  shewn  that
the action  of the circum-solar  force upon  all the  planets  (reduced  to equal
distances)  is as the matter  of  the planets  ; that  the action  of  the circum-
jovial  force upon  the  satellites  of  Jupiter  observes  the same  law  ; and  the
same  thing  is to be said  of the  attraction  of  all  the planets  towards  every
planet : but  thence  it follows  (by Prop. LXIX)   that  their  attractive  forces
are  as their  several  quantities  of matter.
   As  the parts  of the  earth mutually  attract  one  another,  so do those  of
all the planets.  If Jupiter and  its satellites  were brought  together,  and
formed  into  one  globe, without  doubt  they would  continue  mutually  to
 attract  one  another  as before.  And,  on  the  other  hand,  if the body  of
 Jupiter  was  broke  into more  globes,  to be  sure, these  would  no  less  attract.

| only stopped and | sustained ther | eby. |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Suppose now | that ACB repr | esents some | small | body on the | earth's sur |

| maining part A | CD of the ea | rth towards | each | other, are equ | al, but the |

| the attraction o | f the earth t | owards the p | articl | e will likewi | se be as the |

| The forces (p. | 396), which ar | e as the mat | ter i | n terrestrial b | odies of all |

3ne  another  than  they  do  the  satellites now.  From  these  attractions  it is
that  the  bodies  of the  earth  and  all the planets  effect  a spherical  figure, and
their  parts  cohere, and  are  not  dispersed  through  the aether.  But  we have
before proved  that  these  forces  arise  from  the  universal  nature  of matter
(p. 398), and  that, therefore,  the force  of any  whole  globe  is made  up  of
the several  forces  of  all  its parts.  And  from  thence  it follows  (by Cor.
III, Prop. LXXIV)   that  the  force  of every  particle  decreases  in the dupli
cate proportion  of the distance  from  that  particle  ; and  (by Prop. LXXIII
and LXXV)   that  the  force  of  an  entire  globe, reckoning  from  the surface
outwards,  decreases  in the  duplicate,  but, reckoning  inwards,  in  the  sim
ple proportion  of the distances  from  the  centres,  if the matter  of the globe
be  uniform.    And  though  the  matter  of the  globe, reckoning  from   the
centre  towards  the surface,  is not uniform  (p. 398,  399), yet  the decrease  in
the duplicate  proportion  of the distance  outwards  would  (by Prop. LXXVI)
take  place, provided   that  difformity   is similar  in places round  about  at
equal  distances  from  the  centre.   And  two  sucli globes  will (by the same
Proposition)  attract  one  the  other  with  a  force  decreasing  in the duplicate
proportion  of  the distance  between,  their  centres.
  Wherefore  the absolute  force  of every  globe  is as the quantity  of matter
which  the  globe  contains ; but  the  motive  force  by which  every  globe  is
attracted  towards  another, and  which,  in  terrestrial  bodies,  we commonly
call their weight,  is as the content  under  the  quantities  of matter  in both
globes  applied  to the square  of  the distance  between  their  centres  (by Cor.
IV, Prop. LXXVI),   to which  force  the quantity  of motion,  by which  each
globe  in  a given  time  will  be  carried  towards  the  other,  is proportional.
And  the  accelerative  force, by which  every  globe according  to  its quantity
of matter  is attracted  towards  another,  is as the quantity  of matter  in that
other  globe  applied   to  the  square  of  the distance  between  the centres  of
the two  (by Cor.  II, Prop. LXXVI):   to which  force, the velocity  by which
the attracted  globe  will, in   a given  time,  be carried  towards  the other  is
proportional.    And  from  these  principles  well  understood,  it will  be now
easy  to determine  the motions  of the  celestial  bodies among  themselves.
  From  comparing  the  forces  of  the  planets  one  with  another,  we have
above  seen  that  the circum-solar  does  more  than  a thousand  times  exceed
all the  rest ; but by the  action  of a force  so greab  it is unavoidable  but  that
all bodies  within,  nay,  and  far beyond,  the bounds  of  the planetary  system
must  descend  directly  to the  sun,  unless  by other  motions  they  are impelled
towards  other  parts  : nor  is our  earth  to be  excluded  from  the number  of
such  bodies  : for certainly  the moon  is a body  of the same  nature  with  the
planets, and  subject  to the same  attractions  with  the  other  planets, seeing
it is by the circum-terrestrial  force  that  it is retained  in  its orbit.  But
that  the earth and  moon  are  equally  attracted  towards  the  sun, we have
above  proved ; we  have  likewise  before  proved  that  all bodies  are  subject  to

| 3ne another | than they | do t | he satellites now | . From t | hese att | ractions it is |
| that the bodi | es of the | earth | and all the plan | ets effect | a spherica | l figure, and |
| their parts c | ohere, and | are | not dispersed th | rough the | aether. | But we have |
| before prove | d that the | se fo | rces arise from | the univer | sal natu | re of matter |
| (p. 3 98), and | that, the | refore | , the force of a | ny whole | globe is | made up of |
| the several | forces of | all i | ts parts. And | from thenc | e it fol | lows (by Cor. |
| III, Prop. L | XXIV) t | hat th | e force of every | particle d | ecreases | in the dupli |
| cate proport | ion of the | dist | ance from that p | article ; an | d (by Pr | op. LXXIII |
| and LXXV) | that the | force | of an entire gl | obe, reckon | ing from | the surface |
| outwards, de | creases i | n the | duplicate, but, | reckoning | inwards, | in the sim |
| ple proportio | n of the | distan | ces from the ce | ntres, if th | e matter | of the globe |
| be uniform. | And t | hough | the matter of | the globe, | reckoni | ng from the |
| centre towar | ds the sur | face, | is not uniform | (p. 3 98, 399 | ), yet th | e decrease in |
| the duplicate | proportio | n of | the distance out | wards woul | d (by Pr | op. LXXVI) |
| take place, | provided | that | difformity is s | imilar in p | laces ro | und about at |
| equal distan | ces from | the c | entre. And two | sucli glo | bes will | (by the same |
| Proposition) | attract o | ne th | e other with a | force decrea | sing in | the duplicate |
| proportion o | f the dis | tance | between, their ce | ntres. |  |  |
| Wherefore | the abso | lute | force of every gl | obe is as th | e quanti | ty of matter |
| which the g | lobe cont | ains | ; b ut the motive | force by | which e | very globe is |
| attracted to | wards ano | ther, | and which, in | terrestrial | bodies, w | e commonly |
| call their we | ight, is a | s the | content under t | he quantit | ies of ma | tter in both |
| globes appli | ed to the | squar | e of the distance | between | their cen | tres (by Cor. |
| IV, Prop. LX | XVI), t | o whi | ch force the qua | ntity of mo | tion, by | which each |
| globe in a g | iven time | will | be carried tow | ards the o | ther, is | proportional. |
| And the acc | elerative | force, | by which every | globe acco | rding to | its quantity |
| of matter is | attracted | towar | ds another, is as | the quant | ity of ma | tter in that |
| other globe | applied | to th | e square of the | distance be | tween th | e centres of |
| the two (by | Cor. II, P | rop. | LXXVI): to wh | ich force, | the veloc | ity by which |
| the attracted | globe wi | ll, in | a given time, | be carried | towards | the other is |
| proportional. | And f | rom t | hese principles | well under | stood, it | will be now |
| easy to dete | rmine the | moti | ons of the celest | ial bodies | among th | emselves. |
| From co | mparing | the fo | rces of the pla | nets one w | ith anot | her, we have |
| above seen t | hat the c | ircum | -solar does mor | e than a t | housand | times exceed |
| all the rest ; | b ut by t | he act | ion of a force so | greab it is | unavoida | ble but that |
| all bodies wi | thin, nay, | and | far beyond, the | bounds of | the plan | etary system |
| must descend | directly | to th | e sun, unless by | other motio | ns they | are impelled |
| towards othe | r parts : | nor i | s our earth to | be excluded | from th | e number of |
| such bodies | : for certa | inly | the moon is a bo | dy of the | same nat | ure with the |
| planets, and | subject t | o the | same attractions | with the | other pl | anets, seeing |
| it is by the | circum-ter | restri | al force that it | is retaine | d in its | orbit. But |
| that the eart | h and mo | on a | re equally attr | acted towa | rds the | sun, we have |
| above proved | ; we hav | e lik | ewise before prov | ed that all | bodies a | re subject to |

the said common  laws  of attraction.  Nay, supposing  any  of those  bodies
to be deprived  of  its circular  motion  about  the sun, by having  its distance
from  the sun, we  may  find (by Prop. XXXVI)   in what  space  of time  it
would  in its descent  arrive  at the sun  ; to wit, in half  that  periodic  time  in
 .vhich  the body might  be revolved  at one  half  of  its former  distance;  or in
a space  of time  that  is to the periodic  time  of  the planet  as 1 to 4</2;  as
that Venus  in its descent  would  arrive  at  the sun  in the space  of 40  days,
Jupiter  in the space  of two  years  and  one  month,  and  the  earth  and moon
together  in the space  of 66  days  and  19 hours.  But,  since  no  such  thing
happens,  it must  needs  be, that  those  bodies  are moved  towards  other  parts
(p. 75), nor  is every motion  sufficient  for  this purpose.  To  hinder  such  a
descent,  a due proportion  of velocity  is required.  And  hence  depends  the
force of the argument  drawn  from  the retardation  of  the  motions  of  the

planets.  Unless  the circum-solar  force decreased  in  the duplicate  ratio  of
their increasing  slowness,  the  excess  thereof  would  force  those  bodies  to de
scend  to the sun  ; for instance,  if the motion  (c&teris paribns)  was  retarded
by one  half, the planet would  be  retained  in  its orb by one  fourth  of  the
former  circum-solar  force, and  by the  excess  of  the  other  three  fourths
would  descend  to the sun.  And  therefore  the  planets  (Saturn,  Jupiter,
Mars,  Venus,  and Mercury)  are not  really  retarded  in  their  perigees,  nor
become  really stationary,  or  regressive  with  slow  motions.  All  these  are
but  apparent,  and  the  absolute  motions,  by which  the  planets  continue  to
revolve  in their  orbits, are  always  direct, and  nearly equable.  But  that
such  motions  are performed  about  the  sun, we  have  already  proved ; and
therefore  the sun,  as the centre  of the absolute  motions,  is quiescent.  For
we  can by no means  allow  quiescence  to the earth,  lest the planets  in their
perigees  should  indeed  be  truly retarded,  and  become  truly stationary  and
regressive,  and  so  for want  of motion  should  descend  to  the sun.  But
farther  ; since  the  planets  (Venus,  Mars,  Jupiter, and  the  rest) by radi:
drawn  to the sun  describe  regular  orbits, and  areas  (as WTC have  shewn)
nearly  and  to sense  proportional  to the  times,  it follows  (by Prop.  III. and
Cor.  Ill, Prop. LXV)  that  the sun  is moved  with  no  notable  force, unless

perhaps  wTith such  as  all the  planets  are  equally moved  with, according  to
their  several  quantities  of matter,  in parallel  lines, and  so the whole  sys
tem  is transferred  in right lines.  Reject  that  translation  of  the  whole
system,  and  the sun  will  be almost  quiescent  in the centre  thereof.  If  the
gun  was  revolved  about  the earth, and  carried  the other  planets round  about
itself, the earth ought  to  attract  the  sun  with  a  great  force, but  the  cir
cum-solar  planets  with  no  force producing  any  sensible  effect, which  is
contrary  to Cor.  Ill, Prop. LXV.   Add  to  this, that  if hitherto  the  earth,
because  of the gravitation  of  its parts, has been  placed by most  authors  in
the lowermost  region  of  the universe  ; now,  for  better  reason,  the sun  pos
 sessed  of a centripetal  force exceeding  our  terrestrial  gravitation  a thousand

| the said co | mmon laws of | attraction. N | ay, supposin | g any of thos | e bodies |
| to be depri | ved of its circu | lar motion abo | ut the sun, | by having its | distance |
| from the su | n, we may fin | d (by Prop. XX | XVI) in | what space of | time it |
| would in it | s descent arrive | at the sun ; | t o wit, in hal | f that periodi | c time in |
| .vhich the | body might be | revolved at one | half of its | former distan | ce; or in |
| a space of | time that is to | the periodic t | ime of the p | lanet as 1 to | 4</2; as |

| (p. 75), nor | is every motion | sufficient fo | r this purpo | se. To hinde | r such a |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| descent, a d | ue proportion o | f velocity is | required. | And hence dep | ends the |
| force of th | e argument dr | awn from the | retardation | of the motion | s of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| planets. U | nless the circu | m-solar force | decreased in | the duplicate | ratio of |
| their increa | sing slowness, | the excess there | of would fo | rce those bodi | es to de |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| by one half | , the planet wou | ld be retain | ed in its or | b by one fourt | h of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| former cir | cum-solar force, | and by the | excess of t | he other three | fourths |
| would desc | end to the sun | . And theref | ore the pla | nets (Saturn, | Jupiter, |
| Mars, Venus | , and Mercury) | are not real | ly retarded | in their peri | gees, nor |
| become real | ly stationary, o | r regressive | with slow m | otions. All | these are |
| but apparent | , and the abso | lute motions, | by which t | he planets con | tinue to |
| revolve in | their orbits, ar | e always dire | ct, and near | ly equable. | But that |
| such motion | s are performe | d about the | sun, we hav | e already prov | ed ; and |
| therefore th | e sun, as the ce | ntre of the ab | solute motio | ns, is quiesce | nt. For |
| we can by n | o means allow | quiescence to | the earth, l | est the planets | in their |
| perigees sho | uld indeed be | truly retarded, | and becom | e truly statio | nary and |
| regressive, | and so for want | of motion | should desc | end to the s | un. But |
| farther ; si | nce the planets | (Venus, Mars | , Jupiter, | and the rest) | by radi: |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| drawn to th | e sun describe | regular orbit | s, and area | s (as WTC have | shewn) |
| nearly and | to sense proport | ional to the | times, it fol | lows (by Prop. | III. and |
| Cor. Ill, Pr | op. LXV) that | the sun is mo | ved with n | o notable forc | e, unless |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| perhaps wTi | th such as all t | he planets are | equally mo | ved with, acco | rding to |
| their severa | l quantities of | matter, in pa | rallel lines, | and so the wh | ole sys |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| cum-solar | planets with n | o force produ | cing any s | ensible effect, | which is |
| contrary to | Cor. Ill, Prop. | LXV. Add | to this, that | if hitherto t | he earth, |

times  and  more,  ought  to be depressed  into  the lowermost  place, and  to be
held  for the  centre  of  the system.  And  thus  the  true  disposition  of  the
whole  system  will be more  fully and  more  exactly  understood.
   Because  the  fixed  stars  are  quiescent  one  in  respect  of another  (p. 401,
4U2), we may  consider  the  sun,  earth, and  planets,  as  one  system  of  bodies
carried  hither  and  thither  by various  motions  among  themselves;  and  the
common  centre  of gravity  of  all (by Cor.  IT  of  the Laws  of Motion)  will
either  be quiescent,  or move  uniformly  forward  in  a right  line : in which
case  the whole  system  will likewise  move  uniformly  forward  in right  lines.
But  this  is an hypothesis  hardly  to  be admitted  ; and,  therefore,  setting  it
arfide, that common  centre  will  be quiescent:  and from  it the sun  is never
far removed.  The  common  centre  of gravity  of  the sun  and  Jupiter  falls
on  the surface  of  the  sun  ; and  though  all the planets  were  placed  towards
the same  parts from  the  sun  with  Jupiter  the common   centre  of  the  sun

and  all of them  would  scarcely  recede  twice  as  far from  the  sun's  centre  ;
and,  therefore, though  the  sun, according  to  the  various  situation  of  the
planets,  is variously  agitated,  and  always wandering  to and  fro with  a slow
motion  of libration,  yet  it never  recedes  one  entire  diameter  of  its own  body
from  the quiescent  centre  of the  whole  system.  But  from  the weights  of
the sun  and  planets  above  determined,  and  the situation  of  all among  them
selves, their common   centre  of gravity may  be found  ; and,  this being  given,

the  sun's  place  to any  supposed  time may  be obtained.
   About  the sun  thus  librated  the  other  planets  are  revolved  in  elliptic
orbits (p  403), and, by radii drawn  to  the  sun, describe  areas  nearly  pro
portional  to the  times,  as  is explained  in Prop. LXV.   If the sun  was  qui
escent, and  the  other  planets  did  not  act mutually  one  upon  another,  their
orbits would  be  elliptic, and  the  areas  exactly  proportional  to the  times  (by
Prop. XI,  and  Cor.  1, Prop. XIII).  But  the  actions  of the planets  amonir
themselves,  compared  with  the actions  of the sun  on  the  planets,  are  of  no
moment,  and  produce  no  sensible  errors.  And  those  errors  are  less in rev
olutions  about  the sun  agitated  in  the manner  but now  described  than  if
those  revolutions  were  made  about  the sun  quiescent  (by Prop. LXV1,  and
Cor.  Prop. LXVIll),  especially  if the focus  of every  orbit  is placed  in the
common  centre  of gravity  of all the lower  included  planets;  viz., the  focus

of the  orbit  of Mercury  in the 'centre  of  the  sun  : the focus  of the  orbit  of
Venus  in the common  centre  of gravity  of Mercury  and  the  sun  ; the focus
of  the  orbit  of  thp earth  in the common  centre  of gravity  of Venus,  Mer
cury,  and  the  sun  ; and  so of  the rest.  And  by  this means  the  foci of  the
crbits  of  all the planets,  except  Saturn,  will  not  be sensibly removed  from
the centre  of the  sun,  nor  will  the focus  of the  orbit  of Saturn  recede  sensi
bly from  the common  centre  of gravity  of Jupiter  and  the sun.  And
therefore  astronomers  are  not  far from  the  truth, when  they reckon  the

sun's  centre  the common  focus  of all the planetary  orbits.  In Saturn  itself

| times and more, | ought to b | e | depressed i | nto the l | owerm | ost place, an | d to be |
| held for the cen | tre of the | sy | stem. And | thus th | e true | disposition | of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| whole system w | ill be more | fu | lly and mor | e exactly | unde | rstood. |  |
| Because the | fixed stars a | re | quiescent | one in re | spect | of another | (p. 401, |
| 4U2), we may c | onsider the | sun | , earth, an | d planets | , as o | ne system of | bodies |
| carried hither | and thither | by | various mo | tions am | ong | themselves; | and the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| common centre | of gravity | of | all (by Co | r. IT of | the L | aws of Motio | n) will |
| either be quiesc | ent, or move |  | uniformly | forward | in a | right line : i | n which |
| case the whole | system will | li | kewise move | uniform | ly fo | rward in righ | t lines. |
| But this is an | hypothesis h | ar | dly to be | admitted | ; and, | therefore, se | tting it |
| arfide, that com | mon centre | wil | l be quies | cent: and | from | it the sun | is never |
| far removed. | The common |  | centre of g | ravity of | the s | un and Jupit | er falls |
| on the surface | of the sun ; | an | d though | all the pl | anets | were placed | towards |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the same parts | from the su | n | with Jupit | er the co | mmon | centre of | the sun |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and all of them | would sca | rce | ly recede | twice as | far fr | om the sun's | centre ; |
| and, therefore, | though the | su | n, accordi | ng to the | vari | ous situation | of the |
| planets, is vario | usly agitate | d, | and always | wanderin | g to | and fro with | a slow |
| motion of libra | tion, yet it | nev | er recedes | one entire | diam | eter of its ow | n body |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from the quiesc | ent centre | of | the whole | system. | But | from the wei | ghts of |
| the sun and pl | anets above | det | ermined, a | nd the sit | uation | of all among | them |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| selves, their co | mmon centre | o | f gravity m | ay be fou | nd ; a | nd, this being | given, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the sun's place | to any supp | ose | d time ma | y be obta | ined. |  |  |
| About the su | n thus libr | ate | d the othe | r planets | are | revolved in | elliptic |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| orbits (p 403), | and, by rad | ii | drawn to | the sun, | descri | be areas near | ly pro |
| portional to th | e times, as i | s e | xplained i | n Prop. L | XV. | If the sun w | as qui |
| escent, and the | other planet | s | did not ac | t mutuall | y one | upon anothe | r, their |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| orbits would be | elliptic, an | d t | he areas e | xactly pro | portio | nal to the t | imes (by |
| Prop. XI, and | Cor. 1, Prop | . | XIII). Bu | t the act | ions o | f the planets | amonir |
| themselves, com | pared with | th | e actions | of the sun | on t | he planets, ar | e of no |
| moment, and p | roduce no s | ens | ible errors | . And th | ose e | rrors are less | in rev |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| those revolution | s were mad | e | about the | sun quiesc | ent ( | by Prop. LXV | 1, and |
| Cor. Prop. LXV | Ill), espec | ial | ly if the f | ocus of e | very | orbit is placed | in the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

the error  thence  arising  docs  not exceed  1 ' 45''.  And  if its orbit, by placing
the focus  thereof  in  the common  centre  of gravity  of Jupiter  and  the  sun,
ghall happen  to agree  better  with  the phenomena,  from  thence  all that  we
have  said  will be farther  confirmed.

   If the sun  was  quiescent,  and  the  planets  did  not  act  one  on  another,  the
aphelions  and  nodes  of their  orbits would  likewise  (by Prop.  1, XI, and  Cor.
Prop. XIU)  be  quiescent. And  the longer  axes  of  their  elliptic orbits
would  (by Prop. XV)  be  as the  cubic  roots  of  the squares  of  their  periodic
times  : and  therefore  from  the given  periodic  times  would  be  also given.
But  those  times  are  to be measured  not from  the equinoctial  points, which
are  rnoveable,  but from  the  first  star  of Aries.  Put  the semi-axis  of the

earth's  orbit  100000,  and  the semi-axes  of  the  orbits  of Saturn,  Jupiter,
Mars,  Venus,  and  Mercury,  from  their  periodic  times,  will come  out

953806,  520116,  152399,  72333,  38710  respectively.  But  from  the  sun's
motion  every  semi-axis  is increased  (bv Prop. LX)  by about  one  third  of
the  distance  of the  sun's  centre  from  the common  centre  of gravity  of
the sun  and  planet  (p. 405, 406.)  And  from  the  actions  of the  exterior
planets  on  the  interior,  the  periodic  times  of  the  interior  are  something
protracted, though  scarcely  by any  sensible  quantity  ; and  their aphelions
are  transferred  (by Cor.  VI  and  VII, Prop. LXVI)by  very  slow  motions
in conset/ue/ttia.  And  on  the like  account  the periodic  times  of  all, espe
cially  of the  exterior  planets,  will  be prolonged  by the  actions  of  the
somets,  if any  such  there  are, without  the  orb  of Saturn,  and  the aphe

lions  of  all will  be  thereby  carried  forwards  in consequent-la.  But  from
the  progress  of the  aphelions  the  regress  of  the nodes  follows  (by Cor.
XI, XIII,  Prop.  1 jXVI).  And  if the plane  of the  ecliptic  is quiescent,  the
regress  of  the nodes  (by Cor. XVI,  Prop. LX.VI)  will  be  to the progress  of

*he aphelion  in every  orbit  as the regress  of  the nodes  of  the moon's  orbit
to the progress  of  its apogeon  nearly,  that  is, as  about  10  to 21.  But  as
tronomical  observations  seem  to confirm  a very  slow  progress  of  the aphe
lions, and  a regress  of the  nodes  in respect  of the  fixed stars.  And  hence
it is probable  that there  are comets  in the regions beyond  the planets, which,
revolving  in very  eccentric  orbs, quickly  fly through  their  perihelion  parts,
and, by an  exceedingly  slow  motion  in their  aphelions,  spend  almost  their
whole  time  in the regions  beyond  the  planets  ; as we  shall afterwards  ex
plain more  at large.
   The  planets  thus  revolved  about  the  sun  (p. 413,  41.4, 415) may  at the
same  time  carry  others  revolving  about  themselves  as  satellites  or moons,
as  appears  by Prop. LXVI.  But  from  the  action  of  the sun  our  moon
must  move  with  greater  velocity,  and, by  a radius drawn  to the  earth, de
scribe  an  area  greater  for the time ; it must  have  its orbit  less curve,  and
therefore  approach  nearer  to the  earth  in the syzygies  than  in the quadra
 tures, except  in so far  as the motion  of  eccentricity  hinders  those  effects.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

                             THE   SYSTEM     OF   THE WORLD.       533


Per  the  eccentricity  is greatest when  the moon's  apogeon  is in the syzygies,
and  least when  the  same  is in  the quadratures  ; and  hence  it is that  the
perigeon  moon  is swifter  and  nearer  to us, but  the apogeon  moon  slower  and
farther  from  us, in the syzygies  than  in the quadratures.  But  farther;  the
apogeon  has  a progressive  and  the nodes  a regressive  motion,  both unequa
ble.  For  the  apogeon  is more  swiftly  progressive  in  its syzygies,  more
slowly  regressive  in  its quadratures,  and by the  excess  of  its progress  above
its regress  is yearly  transferred  in coiisequentia  ; but  the nodes  are  quies
cent  in their  syzygies,  and  most  swiftly  regressive  in their quadratures.  But
farther,  still, the  greatest  latitude  of  the moon  is greater  in  its quadra
tures  than  in its syzygies  ; and  the mean  motion  swifter  in the aphelion  of

the earth  than  in  its perihelion.  More  inequalities  in  the moon's  motion
have  not  hitherto  been  taken  notice  of by astronomers  : but  all these  fol
low  from  our  principles  in Cor.  II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI,
XII,  XIII,  Prop. LXVI,  and  are known  really  to exist  in  the  heavens.
And  this may  seen  in that most  ingenious,  and  if I mistake  not, of  all, the
most  acccurate,  hypothesis  of Mr.  Horrnx,  which  Mr. Flamsted  has  fitted
to the heavens  ; but  the astronomical  hypotheses  are  to be corrected  in the
motion  of  the  nodes  ; for the  nodes  admit  the greatest  equation  or  pros-
thaphaeresis  in their  octants,  and  this inequality  is most  conspicuous  when
the moon  is in the  nodes,  and  therefore  also  in the  octants  ; and  hence  it
was  that  Tycho,  and  others  after  him,  referred  this  inequality  to  the
octants  of  the moon,  and made  it menstrual;  but  the reasons  by us addu
ced prove  that  it ought  to  be  referred  to  the  octants  of  the  nodes, and  to
be made  annual.
   Beside  those  inequalities  taken  notice  of by astronomers  (p. 414, 445,
447,)  there  are  yet some  others, by which  the  moon's  motions  are  so dis
turbed,  that  hitherto  by no  law could  they be reduced  to any  certain  regu
lation.  For  the  velocities  or horr.ry motions  of the  apogee  and  nodes  of
the moon,  and  their  equations,  as well  as the  differs  ice betwixt  the greatest
eccentricity  in the syzygies  and  the  least  in the  < rrdratures,  and  that  ine
quality  which  we  call the variation,  in  the  progress  of the  year  are aug
mented  and  diminished  (by Cor. XIV,  Prop. LXVI)  in the  triplicate  ratio
of  the sun's  apparent  diameter.  Beside  that,  the  variation  is mutable
r.sarly  in the duplicate  ratio  of  the  time between  the quadratures  (by Cor.
 I and  II, Lem.  X, and  Cor. XVI,  Prop. LXVI);  and  all those  inequali
ties are something  greater  in that part  of  the  orbit which  respects  the sun

   By  a computation  (p. 422), which  for brevity's  sake  I do not  describe,  1

| was that Tych | o, and others | after him | , r | eferred this in | equalit | y to the |

| Beside those | inequalities | taken noti | ce | of by astronome | rs (p. | 414, 445, |

the nearest  quadrature  in  a circle whose  radius  is unity  ; and  therefore

that  the square  of the moon's  distance  from  the earth  is as that sum  divid
ed by the horary motion  of  the moon.  Thus   it is when  the variation  in
the octants  is in  its mean  quantity  ; but  if the variation  is greater  or  less,
that versed  sine must  be augmented  or diminished  in the same  ratio.  Let

astronomers  try how  exactly  the  distances  thus found  will  agree  with  fjie
moon's  apparent  diameters.
  From  the  motions  of our  moon  we may  derive  the motions  of themoon*
or satellites  of Jupiter and  Saturn  (p. 413);  for  the mean  motion  of  the
nodes  of  the outmost  satellite  of Jupiter  is to the mean  motion  of the nodes
of our  moon  in  a proportion  compounded  of the  duplicate  proportion  of
the periodic  time  of  the  earth  about  the sun  to the periodic  time  of Jupiter
about  the  sun, and  the simple  proportion  of  the  periodic  time  of the  sat
ellite about  Jupiter  to the periodic  time  of  our moon  about  the earth  (by
Gor. XVI,  Prop. LXVI)  : and  therefore  those  nodes,  in the space  of a hun

dred  years,  are  carried  8° 24' backwards,  or in atitecedeutia.  The  mean
motions  of  the nodes  of the  inner  satellites  are  to the (mean)  motion  of
(the nodes  of) the outmost  as their periodic  times  to  the periodic  time  of
this, by the same  corollary,  and  are  thence given.  And  the motion  of  the
apsis of  every  satellite  in consequentia  is to  the  motion  of  its nodes  in

a/ttecedentia,  as  the motion  of the apogee  of  our moon  to the motion  of  i's
nodes  (by the same  Corollary),  and  is thence  given.  The  greatest  equa
tions  of the nodes  and  line  of the  apses  of each  satellite  are  to the greatest
equations  of  the nodes  and  the  line of the  apses  of  the moon  respectively
as  the  motion  of the  nodes  and  line  of  the  apses  of the  satellites  in the
time  of one  resolution  of the  first equations  to the motion  of the  nodes
and  apogeon  of  the moon  in  the time  of  one  revolution  of  the  last equa
tions.  The  variation  of  a satellite  seen  from  Jupiter  is to the variation
of  our moon  in the same  proportion  as  the whole  motions  of  their  nodes
respectively,  during  the times  in which  the satellite and  our  moon  (after
parting  from)  arc  revolved  (again)  to the  sun, by the same  Corollary  ; ami
therefore  in the outmost  satellite  the variation  does  not  exceed  5"  12  ".
From  the  small  quantity  of those  inequalities, and  the slowness  of  the
motions,  it happens  that  the motions  of  the  satellites  are found  to be  so
regular,  that  the more  modern  astronomers  either  deny  all motion  to  the
nodes,  or  affirm them  to be very  slowly  regressive.

centres, in  the mean  time  they make   their  several  rotations  about  their

proper  axes;  the  sun  in 26  days;  Jupiter  in  9h. 56' ; Mars  in  24f,h. ;
Venus  in 23h. ; and  that in  planes  not much  inclined  to the plane  of  the

find those  motions  are  neither  accelerated   • nor  retarded  l>y the actions  of
the centripetal  forces,  as  appears  by Cor. XXII,  Prop. LXVI   ; and  there
fore of  all others  they  are  the most  equable  and  most  fit for the mensura
tion  of time;  but  those  revolutions  are  to be reckoned  equable  not  from
their  return  to the sun, but  to some  fixed  star:  for as  the  position  of  the
planets  to the sun  is un equably  varied, the  revolutions  of  those  planets
from  sun  to sun  are rendered  unequable.
   In like manner  is  the moon  revolved  about  its axis  by  a motion  most

equable  in  respect  of  the  fixed  stars,  viz., in 27J.  7h. 43', that  is, in  the
space  of a  sidereal  month  ; so  that  this  diurnal  motion   is equal  to the
mean  motion  of  the moon  in  its orbit  : upon  which  account  the same  face
of  the moon  always  respects  the centre  about  which  this mean  motion   is

performed,  that  is, the  exterior  focus  of the moon's  orbit nearly  ; and  hence
arises  a deflection  of  the  moon's  face from  the  earth, sometimes  towards
the  east, and  other  times  towards  the  west, according  to the position  of the
focus  which  it respects  ; and  this deflection  is equal  to the equation  of the

moon's  orbit,  or  to the difference  betwixt  its mean  and  true motions;  and
this  is the moon's  libration  in longitude:  but  it is likewise  affected  with
a libration  in latitude  arising from  the  inclination  of  the moon's  axis  to
the  plane  of  the  orbit  in which  the moon  is revolved  about  the  earth ; for
that  axis  retains  the same  position  to the  fixed  stars  nearly,  and  hence  the
poles present  themselves  to our  view  by turns,  as we  may  understand  from
the example  of the motion  of the  earth, whose  poles, by reason  of the  incli
nation  of  its axis  to the  plane  of  the  ecliptic, are by turns  illuminated  by

the sun.  To  determine  exactly  the  position  of  the  moon's  axis  to the
fixed  stars, and  the variation  of  this  position,  is  a problem  worthy  of  an
astronomer.

  By  reason  of  the diurnal  revolutions  of the  planets,  the  matter  which
they contain  endeavours  to recede  from  the axis  of this motion  ; and  hence
the  fluid  parts  rising higher  towards  the  equator  than  about  the poles
(p. 405), would  lay the  solid  parts about  the equator  under  water,  if those
parts  did  not  rise also  (p. 405, 409)  : upon  which  account  the planets  are
something  thicker  about  the equator  than  about  the poles ; and  their equi
noctial  points  (p. 413)  thence  become  regressive  ; and  their  axes, by  a
motion  of nutation,  twice  in every  revolution,  librate  towards  their  eclip
tics, and  twice  return  again  to their  former  inclination,  as  is explained  in
Cor. XVIII,  Prop. LXVI  ; and  hence  it  is that  Jupiter,  viewed  through
very long  telescopes,  does  not  appear  altogether  round  (p. 409). but having
its diameter  that  lies parallel  to  the  ecliptic something  longer  than  that
which  is drawn  from  north  to south.

   And  from  the diurnal  motion  and  the attractions  (p. 415, 418)  of the
Bun  and moon  our  sea ought  twice  to rise and  twice  to fall every  day,  as
well  lunar  as  solar  (by Cor. XIX,  XX,  Prop. LXVI),  and  the  greatest

height  of the water  to happen  before  the  sixth  hour  of either day and  aftei
the twelfth  hour preceding.  By  the slowness  of the  diurnal  motion  the
flood  is retracted  to the twelfth  hour  ; and  by the  force  of  the motion  of
reciprocation  it is protracted  and  deferred  till a  time  nearer  to the sixth
hour.  But  till that  time  is more  certainly  determined  by  the pheno
mena,  choosing  the middle  between  those  extremes, why  may  we  not
conjecture  the  greatest  height  of  the water  to happen  at the  third  hour  ?
for thus  the water  will  rise  all that  time  in which  the  force of  the  lumi

naries  to raise  it is greater,  and  will  fall  all that  time  in which  their  force
is less  : viz., from  the ninth  to the third  hour  when  that  force  is greater,
and  from  the  third  to the ninth  when  it is less.  The  hours  I reckon  from

the appulse  of each  luminary  to the meridian  of  the  place, as  well under
as above  the horizon  ; and  by the hours  of  the lunar  day  I understand  the

twenty-fourth  parts  of  that  time which  the moon  spends  before  it comes
about  again by  its apparent  diurnal  motion  to the  meridian  of  the place
which  it left the day  before.
   But  the two  motions  which  the two  luminaries  raise  will  not appear  distin
guished,  but  will make   a certain  mixed  motion.  In the conjunction  or op
position  of  the luminaries  their  forces  will  be conjoined,  and  bring  on  the
greatest  flood  and ebb.  In  the quadratures  the  sun  will  raise the  waters
which  the moon  dcpresseth.  and  depress  the waters  which  the moon  raiseth  ;
and  from  the  difference  of their  forces  the smallest  of all tides  will  follow.

And  because  (as experience  tells us) the  force  of the moon  is greater  than
that  of  the  sun, the  greatest  height  of the  water  will happen  about  the
third  lunar hour.  Out  of the  syzygies  and  quadratures  the  greatest  tide
which  by  the single  force  of  the moon  ought  to fall out  at the  third  lunar
hour, and  by the  single  force  of  the  sun  at the third  solar  hour, by the
compounded  forces  of both  must  fall out  in an  intermediate  time  that ap
proaches  nearer  to the third  hour  of  the moon  than  to that  of  the sun:
and,  therefore,  while  the moon   is passing  from  the syzygies  to the quadra
tures, during  which  time  the third  hour  of  the sun  precedes  the third  of
the moon,  the  greatest  tide  will precede  the third  lunar  hour, and  that by
the  greatest  interval  a little  after  the octants  of  the  moon  ; and  by  like
intervals  the greatest  tide  will follow  the third  lunar  hour, while  the moon
is passing  from  the quadratures  to the syzygies.
   But  the  effects of  the luminaries  depend  upon  their  distances  from  the
earth ; for when  they  are  less distant  their  effects  are  greater,  and when
more  distant  their  effects  are  less, and  that  in the  triplicate proportion  of
their apparent  diameters.  Therefore  it is that  the sun  in  the winter  time,
being  then  in its perigee,  has  a  greater  effect, and  makes  the  tides  in the

syzyii'ies something  greater, and  those  in the quadratures  something  less,
cre/m.<? panbiis,  than  in the summer   season  ; and  every month  the moon,
vhile  in the perigee,  raiseth  greater  tides  than  at the  distance  of  15 days

| conjecture the great | est height of | the | water to | happe | n at the third | hour ? |
| for thus the water | will rise all t | hat | time in whi | ch t | he force of th | e lumi |

| is less : viz., from t | he ninth to | the t | hird hour | when | that force is | greater, |
| and from the third | to the ninth | when | it is less | . The | hours I reck | on from |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the appulse of each | luminary to | the | meridian | of the | place, as wel | l under |

| twenty-fourth parts | of that time | whi | ch the mo | on s | pends before | it comes |
| about again by its | apparent diur | nal | motion to | the | meridian of t | he place |
| which it left the day | before. |  |  |  |  |  |
| But the two motio | ns which the | two | luminaries | raise | will not appear | distin |

| and from the differe | nce of their | force | s the small | est o | f all tides will | follow. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| And because (as exp | erience tells | us) | the force of | the | moon is great | er than |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that of the sun, the | greatest hei | ght | of the wa | ter w | ill happen ab | out the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| proaches nearer to | the third ho | ur o | f the moon | tha | n to that of t | he sun: |
| and, therefore, while | the moon is | pas | sing from | the sy | zygies to the | quadra |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| tures, during which | time the thi | rd h | our of the | sun | precedes the | third of |

 K'forc  or  after, when  it is in  its apogee.  Whence   it comes  to pasa  that  two
nighest  tides  do  not  follow  one  the other  in  two immediately  succeeding
syzygies.
   The  effect of  either luminary  doth  likewise  depend  upon  its declination
or distance  from  the equator ; for  if the luminary  was  placed  at  the  pole,
it would  constantly  attract  all the  parts  of the  waters,  without  any  inten
sion  or remission  of its action, and  could  cause  no  reciprocation  of motion  ;
and,  therefore,  as  the luminaries  decline  from  the equator  towards  either
pole, they  will by degrees  lose their  force, and  on  this account  will  excite
lesser  tides  in the  solstitial  than  in the  equinoctial  syzygies.  But  in the
solstitial quadratures  they  will  raise greater  tides  than  in the quadratures
about  the equinoxes  ; because  the  effect  of the moon,  then  situated  in the
equator,  most  exceeds  the  effect  of  the  sun  ; therefore  the  greatest  tides
fall out  in those  syzygies.  and  the  least  in those  quadratures,  which  happen
about  the time  of both  equinoxes  ; and  the  greatest  tide  in the syzygies  is
always  succeeded  by the  least  tide in  the quadratures,  as  we  lind by expe
rience.  But  because  the sun  is  less distant  from  the earth  in winter  than

in summer,  it cornes  to pass  that  the  greatest  and  least  tides more  fre
quently  appear  before  than  after  the vernal  equinox,  and more  frequently
after  than  before  the autumnal.                     K N
   Moreover,  the  effects  cf  che lumina
ries depend  upon  the latitudes  of places.

at the  third Lour  after  the appulse  of the rnoon  to  the meridian  under  tht
horizon  , and.  lastly, the  greatest  ebb  in Q.  at  the  third  hour  after  the

rising of  the moon;  and  the  latter  flood iny"  will  be  less than  the preced
ing flood  in F   For  the whole  sea  is divided  into two  huge  and  hemis
pherical  floods, one  in the hemisphere  KH/rC  on  the north  side, the  other
in the opposite hemisphere  KH/cC,  whicli  we  may  therefore  call  the north
ern  and  the southern  floods  : these  floods  being always  opposite  the  one  to
the  other, come  by turns  to the  meridians  of  all  places  after  the  interval
of twelve  lunar  hours  ; and, seeing  the northern  countries  partake  more
of  the northern  flood, and  the  southern  countries  more  of  the  southern
flood, thence  arise  tides  alternately  greater  and  less in  all places without
the equator  in Avhich  the  luminaries  rLe  and  set.  But  the  greater  tide
will happen  when  the moon  declines  towards  the vertex  of the  place, about
the  third  hour  after  the -appulse  of  the moon   to the meridian  above  the
horizon  ; and when  the moon  changes  its declination,  that which  was  the
greater  tide  will  be changed  into a  lesser ; and  the  greatest  difference  of
the  floods  will  fall out  about  the times  of  the  solstices,  especially  if the
ascending  node  of  the moon  is about  the  first of Aries.  So the  morning
tides  in winter  exceed  those  of  the evening, and  the  evening  tides  exceed
those  of  the morning  in summer  ; at Plymouth  by the height  of  one  foot,
but  at Bristol  by  the height  of  15  inches, according  to the observations  of
Qvleptvss  and  Stitrnnj.
   But  the motions  which  we  have  been  describing  suffer some  alteration
from  that  force  of  reciprocation  which  the  waters  [having  once  received]
retain  a little while  by their  vis  iiisita  ; whence   it comes  to pass  that  the
tides may  continue  for some  time, though  the  actions  of  the  luminaries
should  cease.  This  power  of retaining  the  impressed  motion  lessens  the
difference  of  the alternate  tides, and  makes  those  tides which  immediately
succeed  after  the  syzygies  greater, and  those  which  follow  next  after  the

quadratures  less. And  hence  it is that  the  alternate  tides  at  l:'1y month
and  Bristol  do  not  differ much  more  one from  the other  than  by the height

of a foot,  or of  15 inches;  and  that  the greatest  tides  <~>f all at  those  ports
are  not  the  first but  the  third  after  the syzygies.
   And.  besides,  all the motions  are  retarded  in their  passage  through  shal
low  channels,  so that  the greatest  tides of  all, in some  strai  s and  mouths
of rivers,  are  the  fourth,  or  even  the  fifth, after  the syzygies.
   It may  also happen  that  the  greatest  tide may  be  the  fourth  or  fifth
after  the syzygies,  or  fall out  yet  later, because  the motions  of  the  sea  are
retarded  in passing  through  shallow  places towards  the shores:  for  so the
tide  arrives  at the western  coast  of Ireland  at the  third  lunar  hour, and  an

hour  or two  after  at the ports  in the southern  coast  of the same  island  ; as
also  at the islands  Cftssiterides, commonly  Sorliti^s  ; then  successively  at
Palrnonth.  Plymouth,  Portland,  the  isle of Wight,  Winchester,  Dover,

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| But the moti | ons which | we have b | een d | escribing suffer | som | e alteration |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from that force | of recipro | cation whic | h the | waters [havin | g on | ce received] |

this passage.  But  farther;  the propagation  of the  tides may  he obstructed
even  by the channels  of the ocean  itself, when  they  are  not  of depth enough,
for the  flood happens  at the third  lunar  hour  in the Canary  islands  ; and
at  all those  western  coasts  that  lie towards  the Atlantic  ocean,  as of  Ire
land, France,  Spain,  and  all Africa,  to  the Cape  of Good  Hope,  except
in some  shallow  places, where  it is impeded,  and  falls out  later ; and  in the
straits of  Gibraltar,  where,  by reason  of  a motion  propagated  from  the
Mediterranean  sea, it flows  sooner.  But,  passing from  those  coasts  over
the breadth  of the ocean  to the  coasts  of America,  the  flood  arrives  first at
the most  eastern  shores  of Brazil,  about  the  fourth  or  fifth lunar  hour;
then  at the mouth  of the  river  of  the Amazons   at the  sixth  hour,  but  at
the neighbouring  islands  at  the  fourth  hour  ; afterwards  at  the islands  of
Bermudas   at  the seventh  hour, and  at port  St. An^nstin  in Florida  at
seven  and  a half.  And  therefore  the  tide  is propagated  through  the ocean
with  a slower  motion  than  it should  be according  to  the  course  of  the
moon  ; and  this retardation  is very  necessary,  that  the  sea  at the same  time
may  fall between  Brazil  and New  France,  and  rise at the Canary  islands,
and  on  the  coasts  of Europe  and  Africa,  and  vice versa  : for the  sea  can
not  rise in  one  place  but  by falling  in another.  And   it is probable  that
the  Pacific  sea  is agitated  by the same  laws  : for  in the coasts  of Chili  and
Peru  the highest  flood  is said  to happen  at  the  third  lunar  hour.  But
with  what  velocity  it  is thence  propagated  to  the  eastern  coasts  of
Japan,  the Philippine  and  other  islands  adjacent  to China,  I have  not
yet learned.
   Farther;   it may  happen  (p. 418)  that  the  tide may  be propagated  from
 the ocean  through  different  channels  towards  the same  port, and may  pass
quicker  through  some  channels  than  through  others,  in which  case  the
same  tide, divided  into two  or more  succeeding  one  another, may  compound
 new  motions  of different kinds.  Let  us suppose  one  tide  to be divided  into
 two  equal  tides, the former  whereof  precedes  the  other by the space  of  six

 hours,  and happens  at  the  third  or twenty-seventh  hour  from  the appulse
 of the moon  to the meridian  of the port.  If  the moon  at the time  of  this
 appulse  to  the meridian  was  in  the  equator,  every  six  hours  alternately
 there would  arise  equal  floods, which,  meeting  with  as many  equal  ebbs,

 would  so balance  one  the  other,  that, for  that  day,  the water  wrould  stag
 nate, and  remain  quiet.  If  the moon  then  declined  from  the equator,  the
 tides  in the ocean  would  be  alternately  greater  and  less, as was  said;  and
 from  hence  two  greater  and  two  lesser  tides would  be alternately  propa
 gated  towards  that port.  But  the  two  greater  floods would  make  the
 greatest  height  of  the waters  to fall out in  the  middle  time  betwixt  both,
 and  the  &Greater  and  lesser  floods would  make  the  waters  to rise  to  a mean
 height  in the middle  time  between  them;  and  in the middle  time  between

| the mouth of the | Thames, | arid Londo | n Btid | gey spending | twelve | hours in |
| this passage. But | farther | ; the propag | ation | of the tides | may he | obstructed |
| even by the channel | s of the | ocean itself | , when | they are not | of dept | h enough, |
| for the flood happe | ns at th | e third lun | ar hour | in the Can | ary isl | ands ; and |
| at all those wester | n coasts | that lie t | owards | the Atlantic | ocean, | as of Ire |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| land, France, Spa | in, and | all Africa, | to the | Cape of G | ood Hop | e, except |
| in some shallow pl | aces, whe | re it is imp | eded, a | nd falls out | later ; | and in the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| straits of Gibralta | r, where | , by reason | of a | motion pro | pagated | from the |
| Mediterranean sea | , it flo | ws sooner. | But, p | assing from | those c | oasts over |
| the breadth of the | ocean t | o the coasts | of Amer | ica, the fl | ood arriv | es first at |
| the most eastern s | hores of | Brazil, ab | out th | e fourth or | fifth lu | nar hour; |
| then at the mouth | of the | river of the | Amazo | ns at the | sixth ho | ur, but at |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the neighbouring | islands | at the fourt | h hour | ; afterwards | at the | islands of |
| Bermudas at the | seventh | hour, and | at port | St. An^nst | in in | Florida at |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| seven and a half. | And th | erefore the | tide is | propagated | through | the ocean |
| with a slower mot | ion than | it should | be acc | ording to | the cour | se of the |
| moon ; and this re | tardation | is very ne | cessary, | that the sea | at the | same time |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| may fall between | Brazil a | nd New Fra | nce, an | d rise at th | e Canar | y islands, |
| and on the coasts | of Europ | e and Afri | ca, and | vice versa | : for th | e sea can |
| not rise in one pl | ace but | by falling | in anot | her. And | it is pro | bable that |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the Pacific sea is | agitated | by the same | laws : | for in the c | oasts of | Chili and |
| Peru the highest | flood is | said to hap | pen at | the third | lunar h | our. But |
| with what veloc | ity it i | s thence p | ropagat | ed to the | eastern | coasts of |
| Japan, the Philip | pine an | d other isl | ands ad | jacent to C | hina, I | have not |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| yet learned. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Farther; it ma | y happen | (p. 418) t | hat the | tide may b | e propag | ated from |
| the ocean through | differen | t channels | towards | the same p | ort, and | may pass |
| quicker through | some ch | annels tha | n thro | ugh others, | in whic | h case the |
| same tide, divided | into two | or more su | cceedin | g one anothe | r, may | compound |
| new motions of di | fferent k | inds. Let | us supp | ose one tide | to be di | vided into |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| two equal tides, t | he former | whereof p | recedes | the other b | y the s | pace of six |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| hours, and happen | s at th | e third or t | wenty-s | eventh hour | from t | he appulse |
| of the moon to th | e meridi | an of the p | ort. If | the moon a | t the ti | me of this |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| appulse to the me | ridian | was in the | equator | , every six | hours | alternately |
| there would arise | equal | floods, which | , meet | ing with as | many | equal ebbs, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| would so balance | one the | other, that, | for tha | t day, the | water w | rould stag |
| nate, and remain | quiet. | If the moon | then | declined fro | m the e | quator, the |
| tides in the ocean | would | be alternate | ly grea | ter and less | , as was | said; and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from hence two g | reater a | nd two les | ser tide | s would be | alternat | ely propa |
| gated towards th | at port | . But the | two gr | eater floods | would | make the |
| greatest height of | the wat | ers to fall | out in | the middle | time be | twixt both, |
| and the Greater a
& | nd lesser | floods woul | d make | the waters | to rise | to a mean |

the two  lesser  floods  the waters  would  rise  to their  least height.  Thus  in

the space  of twenty-four  hours  the waters  would  come,  riot twice,  but  once
only  to their  greatest,  and  once  only  to their  least height  ; and  their great
est height,  if the moon  declined  towards  the elevated  pole, would  happen

at the sixth  or thirtieth  hour  after  the appulse  of the moon   to the meridian         •
and  when  the moon  changed  its declination,  this  flood would  be changed
into  an  ebb.

   Of  all which  we  have  an example  in the  port  of Batsham,  in the king

dom  of Tunquin.  in  the  latitude  of  20°  50' north.  In  that  port, on  the
day which  follows  after  the  passage  of  the moon  over  the  equator,  the
waters  stagnate  ; when  the moon  declines  to  the  north,  they begin  to fluw
and  ebb, not  twice,  as  in  other  ports, but  once  only every  day  ; and  the
flood happens  at the  setting, and  the greatest  ebb  at the  rising  of the moon.
This  tide increaseth  with  the declination  of  the moon   till the seventh  or

eighth day ; then  for  the seventh  or  eighth  day following  it decreaseth  at
the same  rate  as  it had  increased  before, and  ceaseth  when  the moon
changeth  its declination.  After  which  the  flood  is immediately  changed
into  an  ebb ; and  thenceforth  the ebb happens  at  the  setting  and  the  flood
at the rising  of  the moon,  till the moon  again  changes  its declination.
There  are two  inlets from  the ocean  to this port;  one  more  direct  and  short
between  the  island Hainan  and  the  coast  of QuanttiHg,  a  province  of
China  ;  the other round  about  between  the  same  island  and  the  coast  of
Cochim  ; and  through  the shorter  passage  the  tide  is sooner  propagated  to
Batsham.

   In  the channels  of rivers  the  influx  and  reflux  depends  upon  the current
of  the  rivers, which  obstructs  the ingress  of  the  waters  from  the  sea. and
promotes  their  egress  to  the  sea, making  the ingress  later and  slower,  and
the  egress  sooner  arid faster; and  hence  it is that  the  reflux  is of  longer
duration  that  the  influx,  especially  far up  the  rivers, where  the  force  of the
sea  is less.  So Sturmy   tells us, that  in the  river Avon,  three  miles  below
Bristol,  the water  flows  only  five hours,  but  ebbs  seven  ; and  without  doubt
the difference  is yet  greater  above  Bristol,  as at Carcs/iam  or the Bath.
This  difference  does  likewise  depend  upon  the quantity  of  the  flux and  re
flux ; for the more  vehement  motion  of  the  sea  near  the  syzygies  of  the
luminaries  more  easily overcoming  the  resistance  of  the  rivers,  will make
the  ingress  of  the water  to happen  sooner  and  to continue  longer, and  will
therefore  diminish  this difference.  But  while  the moon  is approaching  to
the syzygies,  the  rivers  will  be more  plentifully  filled, their  currents  being
obstructed  by the greatness  of the  tides, and  therefore  will something  more
retard  the  reflux  of the  sea  a  little after than  a little before  the syzygies.

Upon  which  account  the slowest  tides of  all will  not happen  in the syzy-
^ies, but  precede  them  a little ; and  I observed  above  that  the  tides  before
the sy/ygies  were  also  retarded  by the  force  of the  sun  ; and  from  both

| only to their great | est, and onc | e only to their | least height | ; and | their great |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| at the sixth or thir | tieth hour | after the appulse | of the moo | n to the | meridian • |
| and when the moo | n changed | its declination, | this flood | would | be changed |

| Of all which we | have an e | xample in the p | ort of Bats | ham, i | n the king |

| and ebb, not twice | , as in ot | her ports, but | once only e | very da | y ; and the |
| flood happens at t | he setting, | and the greatest | ebb at the | rising o | f the moon. |
| This tide increaset | h with the | declination of | the moon | till the | seventh or |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| Batsham. |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| In the channels | of rivers th | e influx and re | flux depends | upon | the current |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the rivers, whic | h obstructs | the ingress of | the waters | from | the sea. and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| promotes their egr | ess to the | sea, making the | ingress lat | er and | slower, and |
| the egress sooner | arid faster; | and hence it i | s that the | reflux i | s of longer |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| duration that the | influx, espec | ially far up the | rivers, whe | re the | force of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

| luminaries more e | asily overco | ming the resis | tance of the | rivers, | will make |
| the ingress of the | water to h | appen sooner an | d to continu | e longe | r, and will |
| therefore diminish | this differ | ence. But whil | e the moon | is app | roaching to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the syzygies, the r | ivers will b | e more plentifu | lly filled, t | heir cur | rents being |

causes  conjoined  the retardation  of the  tides  will  be both  greater  and  sooner
before  the syzygies.  All  which  I find  to be  so, by the  tide-tables  which
Ftamsted  has composed  from  a great many  observations.
  By  the laws  we have  been  describing,  the times  of the  tides  are governed  ;
but  the greatness  of  th-e tides depends  upon  the greatness  of the seas.  Let
C  represent  the  centre  of the  earth, EAUB   the  oval  figure  of the  seas, CA
the longer  semi-axis  of  this  oval, OB  the  shorter  insisting  at right angles
upon  the former, D  the middle  point  between  A  and  B, and EOF   or eCf
the angle  at the centre  of  the  earth, subtended  by the breadth  of  the  sea
that  terminates  in the shores  E, F, or e,f.  Now,  supposing  that  the point





A  is in the middle  between  the points  E, F, and  the point D  in the middle
between  the points  e,/,  if the  difference  of  the  heights CA,  CB,  represent
the quantity  of  the  tide  in  a very deep  sea surrounding  the whole  earth,
the excess  of the height CA  above  the height OE  or OF  will represent  the
quantity  of the  tide  in the middle  of the  sea EF,  terminated  by the shores
E, F ; and  the excess  of  the  height Ce  above  the  height Cf  will  nearly

represent  the quantity  of the  tide  on  the shores/"  of the same  sea. Whence
it appears  that  the  tides  are  far  less  in the middle  of  the  sea  than  at  the
shores  ; and  that  the  tides  at the shores  are  nearly  as EF   (p. 451,  452), the
breadth  of  the  sea  not  exceeding  a quadrantal  arc.  And  hence  it is that
near  the equator,  where  the  sea  between  Africa  and  America   is narrow,
the  tides  are far  less than  towards  either  side  in the temperate  zones,  wrhere
 the seas  are extended  wider  ; or  on  almost  all the shores  of the  Pacific  sea;
 as well towards  America   as towards  China,,  and  within  as well  as without
 the tropics ; and  that  in islands  in the middle  of  the  sea they  scarcely  rise
 higher  than  two  or three  feet, but  on  the  shores  of great  continents  are
 three  or four  times  greater,  and  above,  especially  if the motions  propagated
 from  the ocean  are by degrees  contracted  into  a narrow  space,  and  the water,
 to  fill and  empty  the bays  alternately,  is forced  to flow and  ebb  with  great
 violence  through  shallow  places ; as Plymouth  and  Chepstow  Bridge  in

 England)  at the mount  of  >S*/. Michael  and  town  of Avranches  in Aor-

| between the poin | ts e,/, if th | e difference | of | the h | eights CA, CB, | represent |
| the quantity of | the tide in | a very dee | p s | ea sur | rounding the w | hole earth, |
| the excess of the | height CA | above the h | eig | ht OE | or OF will re | present the |
| quantity of the | tide in the m | iddle of the | s | ea EF, | terminated by | the shores |
| E, F ; and the e | xcess of the | height Ce | ab | ove th | e height Cf w | ill nearly |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| represent the qua | ntity of the | tide on the | sh | ores/" | of the same sea | . Whence |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| it appears that t | he tides are | far less in t | he | middle | of the sea t | han at the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| shores ; and that | the tides a | t the shores | are | nearl | y as EF (p. 4 51 | , 452), the |

the  sea, hurried  in and  out with  great  violence, sometimes  lays the shores
under  water,  sometimes  leaves them  dry, for many  miles.  Nor  is the  force
of the  influx  and  efflux  to be broke  till it has  raised  or depressed  the water
to forty  or  fifty feet and more.  Thus   also -long  and  shallow  straits  that
open  to the  sea  with  mouths  wider  and  deeper  than  the  rest  of their chan
nel (such  as those  about  Britain  and  the Magellanic  Straits  at the  east
ern  entry)  will have  a greater  flood and  ebb,  or will more  intend  and  remit
their  course,  and  therefore  will  rise higher  and  be  depressed lower.  Or
the  coast  of South  America  it is said  that  the Pacific  sea  in  its reflux
sometimes  retreats  two  miles, and  gets  out  of  sight of  those  that  stand  on
shore.  Whence   in these  places  the floods  will  be also higher  ; but  in deepei
waters  the velocity  of  influx  and  efflux  is always  less, and  therefore  tlu
ascent  and  descent  is so too.  Nor  in such  places  is the  ocean known   to
ascend  to more  than  six, eight,  or ten feet.  The  quantity  of the  ascent  I
compute  in the following  manner
   Let  S represent  the  sun, T  the
earth  (419.  420), P  the  moon,
PAGB   the moon's  orbit.  In SP
take SK  equal  to ST  and  SL  to
SK  in the duplicate  ratio  of SK
to SP.  Parallel  to PT  draw LM  ;
and, supposing  the mean  quantity
of  the circum-solar  force  directed  towards  the earth  to be represented  \j
the distance  ST  or SK, SL   will represent  the  quantity  thereof  directed
towards  the moon.  But  that  force  is compounded  of the  parts SM, LM  ;
of which  the  force LM  and  that  part  of SM  which  is represented  by  TJVI,
do disturb  the motion  of  the moon  (as appears  from  Prop. LXVI,  and  its
Corollaries)  In so far  as the  earth  and moon  are  revolved  about  their
common   centre  of gravity,  the earth  will  be liable  to the  action  of the  like
forces.  But  we may  refer  the sums  as  well  of the  forces  as of  the motions
to the moon,  and  represent  the sums  of  the  forces  by the  lines TM  and
ML,  which  are  proportional  to them.  The  force LM,  in  its mean  quan
tity, is to the  force by which  the moon  may  be revolved  in an  orbit, about

of  the  lines TM,  Ml,.  And  these  are  the  forces  of the  sun, by which  the
moon's  motions  are  disturbed.

   If from  the moon's  orbit  (p. 449V  we descend  to the  earth's  surface,  those
forces  will  be  diminished  in the  ratio  of the  distances  60|  and  1 ; and
therefore  the  force LM   will then  become  3S604600  times  less than  the

force  of gravity.  But  this  force  acting  equally  every  where  upon  the
earth,  will scarcely  effect any  change  on  the motion  of  the  sea, and  there
fore may  be neglected  in the explication  of  that motion.  The  other  force

'I'M, in places where  the sun  is vertical, or  in  their  nadir,  is triple  the
quantity  of the  force ML,  and  therefore  but 12868200  times  less than  the
force  of gravity.

at 90  degrees  distance  from  the former  ; ACEwz/A'   a right angled  cylmdric
canal  passing  through  the  earth's centre.  The  force TM   in any  place  is
as the distance  of  the place from  the  plane DE,  on which  a  line fr^m  A
to C  insists  at right  angles, and           J)
therefore  in the  part  of  the  ca
nal which  is represented  by EC
ini  is of  no  quantity,  but  in the
other  part AClk   is as the gravity
at  the  several  heights ; for in  /

descending  towards  the  centre  of  7; -pi
the  earth, gravity  is (by Prop-   ;
LXX1II)  every  where  as  the
height  ; and  therefore  the  force
TM  drawing  the water  upwards
will  diminish  its gravity  in  the
leg AC//J  of the canal  in  a given
ratio  : upon  which  account  the
water  will  ascend  in this  leg, till its  defect  of gravity  is supplied by  its
greater  height  : nor  will  it rest  in  an  equilibrium   till its total  gravity
becomes  equal  to the  total gravity  in EC/m,  the  other  leg of  the  canal.

Because  the  gravity  of every  particle  is as  its distance  from  the  earth's
centre,  the weight  of  the whole  water  in  either  leg  will increase  in the
duplicate  ratio  of the height  ; and  therefore  the height  of the water  in the

leg AC/A*  will  be  to the height  thereof  in  the leg C/wE   in the subdupli-
cate  ratio  of  the number  12868201  to 12808200,  or in  the  ratio  of  the

found  by the mensuration  of the French  ; and,  therefore, by the preceding
analogy,  the difference  of the  heights  comes  out  9} inches  of the Paris
foot ; and  the  sun's  force  will make  the height  of  the  sea  at A  to exceed
the height  of the same  at E  by 9 inches.  And  though  the  water  of  the
canal  ACE/??7/,:  be supposed  to be frozen  into  a hard  and  solid  consistence,
yet the heights  thereof  at A  and  E, and  all other  intermediate  places, would
still remain  the same.
   Let  Act  (in the following  figure) represent  that  excess  of height  of  9
inches  at A, and  hf the  excess  of height  at  any  other  place h;  and  upon

drawn  thereto may  be considered  as  parallel, the  force TM   in any  place /
will be  to the same  force  in the place A  as the  sine FG   to the radius  AC.
And,  therefore,  since  those  forces  tend  to  the sun  in the direction  of  par

may  infer  the proportion  of the  ascent and  descent  of  the waters  at any
given  place under  the  equator,  as  well  as of  the diminution  of that ascent

the  parallels, from  observations  accurately made  in  our  northern  climates
we  may  determine  the  proportion  of the  forces L  and  S ; and  then by
means  of  this rule  predict  the quantities  of  the  tides  to every  syzygy  and
quadrature.
   At  the mouth  of the  river  Avon,  three  miles  below  Bristol  (p. 450  to
453), in spring  and autumn,  the whole  ascent  of  the water  in the conjunc
tion or  opposition  of  the  luminaries  (by the  observation  of Sturnty)  is
about  45  feet, but in  the quadratures  only 25.  Because  the apparent  di
ameters  of  the luminaries  are  not  here  determined,  let us assume  them  in

their mean  quantities,  as  well  as the moon's  declination  in the equinoctial
quadratures  in its mean  quantity,  that  is, 23|°  ; and  the versed  sine  of
double  its complement  will be  1082, supposing  the radius  to be 1000.  But
the declinations  of  the sun  in the equinoxes  and  of the moon  in the syzy-
gies are  of  no  quantity,  and  the  versed  sines  of double  the complements
are  each 2000.  Whence  those  forces become  L +  S  in the  syzygies,  and

/cUOU\ L —  S  in the quadrature^  respectively  proportional  to  the heights

of  the  tides  of 45  and  25  feet, or of  0 and  5 paces.   And,  therefore, mul-
                                                             15138

tiplying  the  extremes   and  the means,  we have 5L  +  5S =  TxTr    L< —




   But  farther  ; I remember  to have  been  told that  in summer  the  ascent  of
the  sea  in the syzygies  is to the  ascent  thereof  in the quadratures  as about
5  to 4.  In  the  solstices  themselves  it is probable  that  the proportion may
be something  less, as  about  6 to 5 ; whence  it would  follow  that  L  is =

5|S  [for then  the  proportion   is      L +     S  : I, — -S      : : 6  : 5].

Till  we  can  more  certainly determine  the  proportion  from  observation,  let
us assume  L =  5^S  ; and  since  the  heights  of the  tides  are  as the  forces
which  excite  them,  and  the  force  of the sun  is able  to raise  the  tides  to the

height  of  nine  inches,  the moon's  force  will  be sufficient  to  raise  the same
to  the  height  of  four  feet. And  if we  allow  that  this height  may  be
doubled,  or perhaps  tripled, by that  force  of reciprocation  which  we  observe
in the motion  of the waters,  and  by which  their motion  once  be ^un  is kept

up  for some  time,  there  will  be  force enough  to generate  all that  quantity
of  tides which  we  really  find  in the  ocean.
  Thus  we have  seen  that  these  forces  are  sufficient  to move  the sea.  But.

so far  as I can  observe,  they will  not  be  able  to produce  any  other  effect
sensible  on  our  earth ; for since  the weight  of  one  grain  in 4000  is not

sensible  in the  nicest  balance  : and  the  sun's  force  to move  the  tides  is
12868200   less than  the force  of gravity  ; arid the sum  of the  forces  of both

moon  and  sun, exceeding  the  sun's  force  only  in the  ratio  of 6^  to 1, is still
2032890  times  less than  the  force  of gravity  ; it is evident  that  both  forces
together  are 500  times  less than  what  is required  sensibly  to increase   * r
diminish  the weight  of any body  in a balance.  And,  therefore,  they  will
not  sensibly move  any suspended  body ; nor  will they produce  any  sensible
eifect  on pendulums,  barometers,  bodies swimming  in stagnant  water,  or in
the  like  statical experiments.  In the  atmosphere,  indeed,  they  will  excite
such  a flux and  reflux  as they do  in  the  sea, but with  so  small  a motion
that  no  sensible  wind  will be thence  produced.
   if the  effects of  both moon  and  sun  in raising  the  tides  (p. 454),  as  well
as  their apparent  diameters,  were  equal among  themselves,  their  absolute
forces would  (by Cor. XIV,  Prop. LXVI)  be  as their magnitudes.  But  the
effect of  the moon  is to  the  effect of  the sun  as about  5|  to 1 ; and  the

moon's  diameter  less than  the  sun's  in the  ratio  of 31 1 to 32^,  or  of 45  to
46.  Now  the force  of the moon  is to be increased  in the  ratio  of the  effect

directly, and  in the  triplicate  ratio  of the diameter  inversely.  Whence  the
force  of  the moon  compared  with  its magnitude  will be  to the  force  of  the
sun  compared  with  its magnitude  in the  ratio compounded  of  5-^- to 1, and
the  triplicate  of 45  to 46  inversely,  that  is, in the  ratio  of about 5^  to  1.
And  therefore  the moon,  in  respect  of  the magnitude  of  its body,  has  an
absolute  centripetal  force  greater  than  the sun  in respect  of the magnitude
of  its body  in  the  ratio  to 5T\  to  1, and  is therefore  more  dense  in the
same  ratio.

   In  the time  of  27'1. 7h. 43', in which  the moon  makes  its revolution  about
the  earth,  a planet may  be revolved  about  the sun  at the distance  of 18.95  1

diameters  of  the  sun  from  the  sun's  centre, supposing  the mean  apparen
diameter  of the sun  to be 32}' ; and  in the same  time  the moon  may  be  r"-
volved  about  the earth  at  rest,  at the distance  of  30  of  the  earth's diame
ters.  If  in both  cases  the number  of diameters  was  the same,  the  absolute

circum-terrestrial  force would  (by Cor.  II, Prop. LXXll)  be  to the  absolute
circum-solar  force  as  the magnitude  of  the  earth  to the magnitude  of  the

tun.  Because  the number  of  the  earth's  diameters  is greater  in the  ratio
of 30  to 18,954,  the body  of  the  earth  will  be  less in the  triplicate  of  that

ratio, that  is, in  the  ratio  of 3||  to 1.  Wherefore  the  earth's  force, for  the
magnitude  of  its body,  is to the  sun's  force, for  the magnitude  of  its body,

as 3f f to  1 : and  consequently  the  earth's  density  to the  sun's  will  be  IL

| 12868200 less than | the for | ce of | gravity | ; arid the su | m of the forces | of both |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| moon and sun, exce | eding t | he sun | 's force | only in the | ratio of 6^ to 1 | , i s still |
| 2032890 times less | than th | e forc | e of gr | avity ; i t is | evident that bot | h forces |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| together are 500 ti | mes les | s tha | n what | is required | sensibly to inc | rease * r |
| diminish the weight | of an | y bod | y in a | balance. A | nd, therefore, t | hey will |

| such a flux and refl | ux as t | hey d | o in t | he sea, but | with so small a | motion |
| that no sensible win | d will | be th | ence pr | oduced. |  |  |
| if the effects of | both mo | on an | d sun | in raising th | e tides (p. 4 54), | as well |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| as their apparent d | iameters | , wer | e equa | l among th | emselves, their | absolute |
| forces would (by Cor | . XIV, | Prop. | LXVI) | be as their | magnitudes. | But the |
| effect of the moon | is to | the e | ffect of | the sun as | about 5| to 1 ; | and the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| moon's diameter les | s than | the su | n's in | the ratio of | 31 1 to 32^, or | of 45 to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 46. Now the force | of the | moon | is to b | e increased i | n the ratio of t | he effect |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| directly, and in the | triplica | te rat | io of t | he diameter | inversely. Whe | nce the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| force of the moon c | ompared | wit | h its ma | gnitude wil | l be to the forc | e of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun compared with | its mag | nitud | e in th | e ratio comp | ounded of 5-^- t | o 1, and |
| the triplicate of 45 | to 46 | inverse | ly, tha | t is, in the r | atio of about 5 | ^ to 1. |
| And therefore the m | oon, i | n resp | ect of | the magnitu | de of its body, | has an |
| absolute centripetal | force g | reater | than | the sun in r | espect of the ma | gnitude |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of its body in the | ratio | to 5T | \ to 1, | a nd is ther | efore more dens | e in the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| In the time of 27' | 1. 7h. 43 | ', in | which | the moon mak | es its revolutio | n about |

the same  ratio.  Since,  then, the moon's  density  is to the  sun's  density  as
5JS  to I, the moon's  density  will  be  to the  earth's  density  as 5r\  to 3f {,
or  as 23  to 16.  Wh.  veforc  since  the moon's  magnitude  is to  the  earth's
magnitude  as about  I to 4l£,  the moon's  absolute  centripetal  force  will be
 to the  earth's  absolute  centripetal  force  as  about  I to 29, and  the quantity
of matter  in the moon  to the quantity  of matter  in the  earth  in the  same-
ratio.  And  hence  the common   centre  of gravity  of the earth  and moon  is
more  exactly determined  than  hitherto  has  been done;  from  the knowledge

of which  AVC may  now  infer  the moon's  distance  from  the  earth  with  greater
accuracy.  But  I would  rather  wait  till the proportion  of the  bodies  of the
moon  and  earth  one  to  the  other  is more  exactly  defined  from  the phae
nomena  of the  tides, hoping  that  in the mean  time  the circumference  of  the
earth may  be measured  from  more  distant  stations  than  any body  has  yet
employed  for  this purpose.
   Thus  I have  given  an  account  of  the system  of  the planets.  As  to the
fixed  stars,  the smallness  of  their annual  parallax  proves  them  to be  re
moved  to immense  distances  from  the system  of  the  planets:  that  this
parallax  is less than  one  minute  is most  certain  ; and  from  thence  it follows
that  the distance  of  the  fixed  stars  is above  360  times  greater  than  the
distance  of Saturn  from  ;he sun.  Such  as  reckon  the  earth  one  of  the

planets, and  the sun  one  of  the  fixed  stars, may  remove  the  fixed  stars  to
yet greater  distances  by the following  arguments:  from  the annual  motion
of the  earth  there would  happen  an  apparent  transposition  of  the  fixed
stars,  one  in respect  of another,  almost  equal  to  their double  parallax:  but
the greater  and  nearer  stars, in respect  of the more  remote,  which  are  only
seen by the  telescope, have  not  hitherto  been  observed  to have  the  least

motion.  If we  should  suppose  that  motion  to be but  less than  20",  the
distance  of the nearer  fixed  stars would  exceed  the mean  distance  of Saturn

by above  2000  times.  Again:  the  disk  of Saturn,  which  is only  17"  or
18"  in diameter,  receives  but  about  ^----'--^.^  of the  sun's  light;  for  so
much  less  is that  disk  than  the whole  spherical  surface  of the  orb  of Saturn.

Now  if we  suppose  Saturn  to rellec* about  { of  this light, the whole  light
reflected  from  its illuminated  hemisphere  will be about  T ^ ^Wo  o"^«~  °^ ^e
whole  light emitted  from  the  sun's hemisphere:  and,  therefore,  since  light
is rarefied  in the duplicate  ratio  of the distance  from  the luminous  body,  if

the sun  was  10000  v/42  times  more  distant  than  Saturn,  it would  yet ap
pear  as lucid  as Saturn  now  does without  its ring, that  is, something  more
lucid  than  a fixed  star of  the  first magnitude.  Let  us, therefore,  suppose
that  the  distance  from  which  the  sun  would  shine  as  a fixed  star  exceeds

that  of Saturn  by about  100,000  times, and  its apparent  diameter  will  be

7V. 16vi. and  its parallax  arising  from  the annual  motion  of the earth  13""   :
and  so great  will  be the  distance,  the apparent  diameter,  and  the parallax
of the  fixed  stars  of the  first magnitude,  in bulk  and  light equal  to our  sun.

| 5JS to I, t | he moon's de | nsity will | be to th | e earth's de | nsity as 5 | r\ to 3f {, |

| of matter i | n the moon | to the quan | tity of | matter in | the earth i | n the same- |

| more exactl | y determine | d than hith | erto has | been done; | from the | knowledge |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of which AVC | may now i | nfer the moo | n's dista | nce from t | he earth wi | th greater |
| accuracy. | But I would | rather wai | t till the | proportion | of the bod | ies of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| moon and e | arth one t | o the other | is more | exactly d | efined from | the phae |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| earth may | be measured | from more | distant | stations t | han any bo | dy has yet |
| employed fo | r this purpo | se. |  |  |  |  |
| Thus I h | ave given a | n account | of the sy | stem of the | planets. | As to the |
| fixed stars, | the smallnes | s of their | annual | parallax p | roves them | to be re |
| moved to i | mmense dis | tances from | the sy | stem of th | e planets: | that this |
| parallax is | less than on | e minute is | most cer | tain ; a nd f | rom thence | it follows |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that the dis | tance of th | e fixed sta | rs is abo | ve 360 ti | mes greater | than the |
| distance of | Saturn fro | m ;he sun. | Such a | s reckon t | he earth o | ne of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| planets, and | the sun on | e of the f | ixed stars | , may remo | ve the fix | ed stars to |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

4>i           THE   SYSTEM      OF   THE  WORLD.

Some  may,  perhaps, imagine  that  a great  part  of the light of the fixed  stars
is intercepted  and  lost in  its passage  through  so  vast  spaces,  and  upon  that
account  pretend  to place  the  fixed  stars  at  nearer  distances;  but  at this
rate  the remoter  stars could  be  scarcely seen.  Suppose,  for example,  that
£ of the  light perish  in  its passage  from  the  nearest  fixed  stars  to  us ; then
| will twice  perish  in  its passage  through  a double  space,  thrice through  a
triple, and  so forth.  And,  therefore,  the fixed  stars  that  are  at a double
distance wHl  be 16  times  more  obscure,  viz., 4 times  more  obscure  on  ac
count  of  the diminished  apparent  diameter  ; and, again,  4 times  more  on
account  of the  lost light.  And, by the same  argument,  the  fixed  stars  at a
triple distance  will  be 9 X  4. X  4, or 144  times  more  obscure;  and  those
at  a quadruple  distance  will be 16 X  4 X  4 X  4, or 1024  times  more  ob
scure:  but  so great  a diminution  of  light  is no ways  consistent  with  the
phenomena  and  with  that hypothesis  which  places  the  fixed  stars  at differ
ent  distances.
  Tne  fixed  stars  being, therefore,  at such  vast  distances  from  one  another
(p. 460,  461),  can  neither  attract  each  other  sensibly, nor  be attracted  by
our sun.  But  the  comets  must  unavoidably  be acted  on by the circum
solar  force ; for  as the comets  were  placed by astronomers  above  the moon,
because  they  were  found  to have  no  diurnal  parallax,  so  their  annual
parallax  is a convincing  proof  of  their descending  into  the regions  of the
planets.  For  all the comets  which  move  in a direct  course,  according  to
the  order  of the  signs, about  the end  of their appearance  become  more  than
ordinarily  slow,  or  retrograde,  if  the earth  is between  them  and  the  sun  ;
and  more  than  ordinarily  swift  if the earth  is approaching  to a heliocen
tric opposition  with them.  Whereas,  on  the other  hand,  those  which  move
against  the order  of the  signs, towards  the end  of  their appearance,  appear
swifter  than  they ought  to  be if the earth  is between  them  and  the sun  ;
and  slower,  and  perhaps  retrograde,  if the earth  is in  the other  side of  its
crbit.  This  is occasioned  by the motion  of  the  earth  in different  situa
tions.  If the  earth  go  the same  way  with  the  comet, with  a  swifter
motion,  the comet  becomes  retrograde;  if with  a slower  motion,  the comet
becomes  slower, however  ; and  if  the earth move  the contrary  way,  it be
comes  swifter  ; and  by collecting  the  differences  between  the slower  and
swifter  motions,  and  the  sums  of  the more  swift  and  retrograde  motions,
and  comparing  them  with  the  situation  and  motion  of  the earth  from,
whence  they  arise, I found, by means  of  this  parallax,  that  the distances
of the comets  at  the  time  they cease  to be  visible  to the naked  eye  are
always  less than  the  distance  of Saturn,  and  generally  even  less than  the
distance  of Jupiter.
   The  same  thing may  be collected  from  the curvature  of  the way  of the
comets  (p. 462).  These  bodies  go on  nearly  in  great  circles  while  their
motion  continues  swift ; but  about  the end  of their  course, when  that  part

| Some may, perha | ps, imagin | e that a | great part of the | light of the fi | xed stars |

| | will twice peri | sh in its | passage t | hrough a double s | pace, thrice t | hrough a |
| triple, and so fo | rth. And, | therefor | e, the fixed stars | that are at | a double |
| distance wHl be | 16 times | more o | bscure, viz., 4 time | s more obscur | e on ac |
| count of the di | minished | apparent | diameter ; and, a | gain, 4 times | more on |
| account of the l | ost light. | And, by | the same argument | , the fixed s | tars at a |
| triple distance w | ill be 9 | X 4. X 4 | , or 144 times mor | e obscure; a | nd those |
| at a quadruple d | istance wi | ll be 16 | X 4 X 4 X 4, or | 1024 times | more ob |

| phenomena and | with that | hypothes | is which places th | e fixed stars | at differ |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Tne fixed star | s being, t | herefore, | at such vast dista | nces from one | another |
| (p. 460, 461), ca | n neither | attract e | ach other sensibly | , nor be attr | acted by |
| our sun. But | the comets | must | unavoidably be ac | ted on by the | circum |
| solar force ; f or | as the com | ets were | placed by astrono | mers above t | he moon, |
| because they we | re found | to have | no diurnal para | llax, so their | annual |
| parallax is a con | vincing p | roof of | their descending i | nto the region | s of the |
| planets. For al | l the come | ts which | move in a direct | course, acco | rding to |
| the order of the | signs, abo | ut the en | d of their appeara | nce become m | ore than |
| ordinarily slow, | or retrog | rade, if | the earth is betwe | en them and | the sun |
| and more than | ordinarily | swift if | the earth is appr | oaching to a | heliocen |
| tric opposition w | ith them | . Wherea | s, on the other h | and, those whi | ch move |
| against the orde | r of the si | gns, towa | rds the end of the | ir appearance | , appear |
| swifter than the | y ought t | o be if | the earth is betwe | en them and | the sun |
| and slower, and | perhaps r | etrograde, | if the earth is i | n the other si | de of its |
| crbit. This is | occasioned | by the | motion of the ea | rth in differe | nt situa |
| tions. If the | earth go | the same | way with the | comet, with | a swifter |
| motion, the come | t becomes | retrogr | ade; if with a slo | wer motion, t | he comet |
| becomes slower, | however ; | and if | the earth move th | e contrary wa | y, it be |
| comes swifter ; | and by co | llecting | the differences b | etween the sl | ower and |
| swifter motions, | and the | sums of | the more swift an | d retrograde | motions, |
| and comparing | them wit | h the s | ituation and moti | on of the ea | rth from, |
| whence they ari | se, I foun | d, by me | ans of this parall | ax, that the | distances |
| of the comets | at the ti | me they | cease to be visible | to the naked | eye are |
| always less than | the dist | ance of S | aturn, and general | ly even less | than the |
| distance of Jupi | ter. |  |  |  |  |
| The same thi | ng may be | collecte | d from the curvatu | re of the wa | y of the |

of  their apparent  motion  which  arises from  the  parallax  bears  a greater
proportion  to their whole  apparent  motion,  they commonly  deviate  from
those  circles  ; and  when  the  earth  goes  to  one  side, they deviate  to  the
other  ; and  this  deflection, because  of  its corresponding  with  the  motion
of  the  earth, must  arise  chiefly from  the parallax ; and  the quantity  there
of  is so  considerable,  as, by my  computation,  to  place  the  disappearing
comets  a good  deal lower  than  Jupiter.  Whence   it follows,  that, when
they approach  nearer  to us in their perigees  and  perihelions,  they  often  de
scend  below  the  orbits  of Mars  and  the inferior  planets.
   Moreover,  this nearness  of  the  cornets  is confirmed  by the annual  paral
lax of  the  orbit, in  so  far  as  the same   is- pretty  nearly  collected  by the
supposition  that  the comets  move  uniformly  in right  lines.  The  method
of collecting  the  distance  of  a comet  according  to  this hypothesis  from
four  observations  (first attempted  by Kepler,  and  perfected by Dr.  Wallis

and  Sir  Christopher  Wren)  is well  known   • and  the comets  reduced  to
this regularity  generally  pass through  the middle  of  the planetary  region.
So  the comets  of  the year 1607  and  1618,  as their motions  are defined by

Kepler,  passed between  the sun  and  the  earth  : that  of the year  16  '4 be
low  the  orbit  of Mars;  and  that in  1680  below  the  orbit  of Mercury,  as
its motion  was  defined  by Sir Christopher  Wren  rind others.  By  a  like
rectilinear  hypothesis,  Hevelius  placed  all the comets  about  which  we have
any  observations  below  the  orbit  of Jupiter.  It  is a false  notion,  there
fore, and  contrary  to astronomical  calculation, which  some  have  enter
tained, who, from  the  regular motion  of  the comets,  either  remove  them
into  the regions  of the  fixed  stars, or deny  the motion  of the  earth   : where
as their motions  cannot  be reduced  to perfect  regularity,  unless  we  suppose
them  to pass through  the  regions  near  the earth  in motion  ; and  these  are
the arguments  drawn  from  the  parallax,  so far  as  it can  be determined
without  an  exact knowledge  of the  orbits  and  motions  of the comets.
  The  near  approach  of  the comets  is farther  confirmed  from  the light  of
their heads  (p. 463, 465) ; for the light of  a celestial  body, illuminated  by
the sun,  and  receding  to remote  parts,  is diminished  in  the quadruplicate
proportion  of  the distance  ; to wit, in one  duplicate  proportion  on  account
of the  increase  of  the  distance  from  the  sun  ; and  in another  duplicate
proportion  on  account  of  the decrease  of the apparent  diameter.  Hence  it
may  be  inferred,  that Saturn  being  at  a double  distance, and  having  its
apparent  diameter  nearly  half  of that  of  Jupiter, must  appear  about   I (5
times  more  obscure  ; and  that,  if its distance  were  4 times  greater,  its
light would  be 256  times  less ; and  therefore  would  be hardly  perceivable

to the naked  eye.  But  now  the comets  often  equal  Saturn's  light, without
exceeding  him  in  their  apparent  diameters.  So  the  comet  of  the year

1668, according  to  Dr. Hooke's  observations,  equalled  in brightness  the
light of a fixed  star of the  first magnitude  ; and  its head,  or the star  ID

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| those circles | ; a | nd when | the eart | h goes to one | side, they d | eviate to the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the earth | , mu | st arise | chiefly fr | om the parallax | ; and the q | uantity there |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of is so co | nsid | erable, a | s, by my | computation, to | place the | disappearing |
| comets a g | ood | deal low | er than J | upiter. Whenc | e it follow | s, that, when |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Kepler, pas | sed | between | the sun a | nd the earth : | that of the y | ear 16 '4 be |

| its motion | was | defined | by Sir Chr | istopher Wren | rind other | s. By a like |
| rectilinear | hypot | hesis, H | evelius pl | aced all the com | ets about w | hich we have |

| tained, who, | fr | om the | regular mot | ion of the com | ets, either | remove them |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| as their mot | ions | cannot | be reduced | to perfect regu | larity, unles | s we suppose |
| them to pas | s th | rough t | he regions | near the earth | in motion ; | and these are |
| the argumen | ts | drawn f | rom the p | arallax, so far | as it can | be determined |
| without an | exac | t knowle | dge of the | orbits and mot | ions of the | comets. |
| The near | ap | proach o | f the comet | s is farther co | nfirmed fro | m the light of |
| their heads | (p. | 463, 465) | ; f or the | light of a celes | tial body, i | lluminated by |

| proportion | of t | he distan | ce ; to wit | , in one duplica | te proportio | n on account |

the middle  of  the coma,  appeared,  through  a telescope  oi  15  feet, as lucid

as Saturn  near  the horizon  ; but  the diameter  of the  head  was  only  25"
that  is, almost  the  same  with  the  diameter  of  a  circle  equal  to Saturn
and  his ring. The  coma  or hair surrounding  the head  was  about  ten  times
as broad;  namely,  4£ min.  Again  ; the  least diameter  of  the hair  of  the

comet  of the year 1682,  observed  by Mr.  'Flamsted  with  a tube  of  16  feet
and measured  with  the micrometer,  was  2'  0'' ; but  the nucleus,  or  star  in
the  middle,  scarcely  possessed  the  tenth  part of  this  breadth,  and  was

therefore  only  11''' or 12"  broad;  but  the  light  and  clearness  of  its head
exceeded  that  of  the year  1680,  and  was  equal  to that  of  the  stars  of  the
first  or second magnitude.  Moreover,  the comet  of the year  1665,  in April,
as Hevelws  informs  us, exceeded  almost  all the fixed  stars  in splendor,  arid
even  Saturn  itself, as being  of  a much  more  vivid  colour ; for  this  comet
was  more  lucid  than  that which  appeared  at the end  of the foregoing  year
and  was  compared  to the  stars  of  the  first magnitude.  The  diameter  of

the coma  was  about  6' ; but  the  nucleus, compared  with  the planets by
means  of a  telescope, was  plainly  less than  Jupiter, and  was  sometime*?
thought  less, sometimes  equal  to the body  of Saturn  within  the ring.  To
this breadth  add  that  of the  ring, and  the whole  face  of Saturn  will  be
twice  as  great  as that  of  the comet,  with  a light not  at  all more  intense   ;
and  therefore  the comet  was  nearer  to the sun  than  Saturn.  From   the

proportion  of  the nucleus  to the  whole  head  found  by  these  observations,

and  from  its breadth, which  seldom  exceeds  8' or  12;, it appears  that  thi-
Btars  of  the comets  are  most  commonly  of the  same  apparent  magnitude
as the planets  ; but  that  their  light may  be compared  oftentimes  with  that
of Saturn,  and  sometimes  exceeds  it.  And  hence  it is certain  that  in their
perihelia  their  distances  can  scarcely  be greater  than  that  of Saturn.  At
twice  that  distance,  the light would  be four  times  less, which  besides  by  its
dim  paleness  would  be  as much  inferior  to  the light  of Saturn  as the  light
of Saturn   is to the splendor  of Jupiter  : but  this difference  would  be easily
observed.  At  a distance  ten  times  greater,  their  bodies  must  be  greattr
than  that  of  the  sun ; but  their  light would  be  100  times  fainter  than
that  of Saturn.  And  at distances  still greater,  their  bodies  would  far
exceed  the  sun  ;. but, being  in  such  dark  regions,  they must  be no longer
visible.  So impossible  is it to place  the comets  in the middle  regions  be
tween  the sun  and  fixed  stars, accounting  the sun  as one  of the  fixed  stars:
for certainly  they would  receive  no more  light  there from  the sun  than  w<?
do  from  the greatest  of  the  fixed  stars.

   So  far 'we have  gone  without  considering  that  obscuration  which  comets
suffer from  that  plenty  of thick  smoke  which  encompasseth  their  heads.
and through  which  the  heads  always  shew  dull  as through  a cloud  ; for
by how  much  the more  a body  is obscured  by this smoke,  by  so much   th.2
more  near  it must  be allowed  to come  to the sun,  that  it may  vie with  the

| exceeded that o | f the yea | r 1680, | and was equal | to that of the | stars of the |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| as Hevelws inf | orms us, | exceeded | almost all the | fixed stars in | splendor, arid |
| even Saturn its | elf, as be | ing of a | much more viv | id colour ; f o | r this comet |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| was more lucid | than tha | t which | appeared at the | end of the fo | regoing year |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| twice as great | as that o | f the com | et, with a ligh | t not at all m | ore intense |
| and therefore t | he comet | was nea | rer to the sun | than Saturn | . From the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| proportion of t | he nucleu | s to the | whole head fo | und by these | observations, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and from its bre | adth, wh | ich sel | dom exceeds 8' | or 12;, it appea | rs that thi- |
| Btars of the com | ets are | most c | ommonly of the | same apparen | t magnitude |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| as the planets ; | b ut that | their li | ght may be comp | ared oftentim | es with that |
| of Saturn, and | sometimes | exceeds | it. And hence | it is certain | that in their |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| perihelia their | distances | can sca | rcely be greater | than that of | Saturn. At |
| twice that dista | nce, the | light wou | ld be four time | s less, which b | esides by its |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| dim paleness wo | uld be a | s much | inferior to the l | ight of Saturn | as the light |
| of Saturn is to | the splen | dor of J | upiter : but this | difference wou | ld be easily |

planets  in  the  quantity  of light which  it reflects  : whence  it is probable
that  the comets  descend  far below  the  orbit  of Saturn,  as we  proved  before
from  their parallax.  But, above  all, the thing  is evinced  from  their  tails,

which  must  be owing  either  to  the  sun's  light  reflected  from  a srnoke
arising from  them, and  dispersing  itself through  the  aether,  or  to  the light
uf  their own  headt.
   In  the former  case  we  must  shorten  the distance  of the comets,  lest we  be

obliged  to allow  that  the smoke  arising from  their  heads  is propagated
through  such  a vast  extent  of space, and  with  such  a velocity  of expansion,
jus will seem  altogether  incredible;  in the  latter  case  the whole  light  of
both  head  and  tail must  be ascribed  to  the  central nucleus.  But,  then,  if
we  suppose  all this light  to be united  and  condensed  within  the disk  of the
nucleus,  certainly  the nucleus  will by far exceed  Jupiter  itself  in splendor,
especially when  it emits  a very large and  lucid  tail.  If, therefore,  under  a less
apparent  diameter,  it reflects more  light,  it must  be much  more  illuminated
by the  sun,  and  therefore  much  nearer  to it.  So  the comet  that appeared
 Dec.  }2 and  15, O.S. Anno  1679,  at  the  time  it emitted  a  very  shining
tail, whose  splendor  was  equal  to that  of many  stars  like Jupiter,  if  their
light were  dilated  and  spread through  so great  a space,  was,  as  to the mag
nitude  of  its nucleus,  less than  Jupiter  (as Mr.  Flaw  sled  observed),  and
therefore  was  much  nearer  to the sun  : nay,  it was  even  less than  Mercury.
For  on  the 17th  of  that  month,  when  it was  nearer  to  the  earth,  it ap
peared  to Cassini  through  a telescope  of 35  feet a little  less than  the globe
of Saturn.  On  the 8th  of this month,  in the morning,  Dr.  ffalfey saw  the
tail, appearing  broad  and  very  short, and  as  if it rose from  the body  of the
sun  itself, at that time  very  near  its rising.  Its form  was  like  that  of  an
extraordinary  bright  cloud  ; nor  did  it disappear  till the sun  itself began
to be seen  above  the horizon.   Its splendor,  therefore,  exceeded  the  light  of
the clouds  till the  sun  rose, and  far surpassed  that  of all the  stars  together,
as yielding  only  to the immediate  brightness  of  the  sun  itself.  Neither
Mercury,  nor Venus,  nor  the moon   itself, are  seen  so  near  the rising  sun.
Imagine  all this  dilated  light  collected  together, and  to be crowded  into

the  orbit  of  the  comet's  nucleus  which  was  less than  Mercury ; by  its
splendor,  thus  increased, becoming  so much  more  conspicuous,  it will vastly
exceed  Mercury,  and  therefore  must  be  nearer  to  the sun.  On  the 12th
and  15th  of the same  month,  this  tail, extending  itself over  a much  greater
space, appeared  more  rare;  but  its light was  still  so vigorous  as to become
visible when  the fixed  stars were  hardly  to be  seen, and  soon  after  to appear
 like a fiery beam  shining  in  a wonderful manner.  From   its length, which
 was  40  or 50  degrees,  and  its breadth  of  2 degrees,  we  may  compute  what
 the light  of the whole  must  be
   This  near  approach  of the comets  to the sun  is confirmed  from  the  situ-
 tion they  are  seen  in when  their  tails appear  most  resplendent;  for when

| that the comet | s descend far | below th | e orb | it of Satur | n, as we pr | oved before |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| from their par | allax. But, | above all, | the | thing is e | vinced from | their tails, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| which must | be owing eit | her to t | he su | n's light | reflected fr | om a srnoke |
| arising from | them, and disp | ersing it | self | through th | e aether, or | to the light |
| uf their own | headt. |  |  |  |  |  |
| In the forme | r case we mus | t shorten | the | distance o | f the comets, | lest we be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| obliged to all | ow that the s | moke ari | sing | from thei | r heads is | propagated |
| through such | a vast extent | of space, | and | with such | a velocity of | expansion, |
| jus will seem | altogether in | credible; | in t | he latter | case the who | le light of |
| both head and | tail must be | ascribed | to t | he central | nucleus. B | ut, then, if |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| we suppose al | l this light to | be united | and | condensed | within the | disk of the |
| nucleus, certai | nly the nucle | us will b | y far | exceed Ju | piter itself | in splendor, |
| especially when | it emits a ve | ry large a | nd l | ucid tail. I | f, t herefore, | under a less |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| apparent diam | eter, it reflect | s more li | ght, | it must be | much more | illuminated |
| by the sun, an | d therefore m | uch neare | r to | it. So th | e comet th | at appeared |

| tail, whose sp | lendor was eq | ual to tha | t of | many star | s like Jupit | er, if their |

| nitude of its | nucleus, less | than Jup | iter | (as Mr. F | law sled obs | erved), and |
| therefore was | much nearer | to the sun | : na | y, it was | even less tha | n Mercury. |
| For on the 17 | th of that m | onth, wh | en i | t was nea | rer to the | earth, it ap |

the head  passes by  the  sun, and  lies hid  under  the  solar  rays, very bright
and  shining  ta  Is, like  fiery beams,  are  said  to issue from  the horizon;  but
afterwards, when  the head  begins  to  appear,  and  is got farther  from  the
sun,  that  splendor  always  decreases, and  turns  by degrees  into  a  paleness
like  to that  of  the milky  way,  but much  more  sensible  at  first ; after  that
vanishing  gradually.  Such  was  that most  resplendent  comet  described by
 Aristotle,  Lib.  1, Meteor. 6.   " The  head  thereof  could  not  be  seen, because
it set before  the  sun,  or  at least was  hid under  the  sun's  rays ; but  the next
day  it was  seen  as well  as might  be ; for, having  left  the sun  but  a very
little way,  it set immediately  after  it ; and  the  scattered  light of  the head
obscured  by the  too great splendour  (of the  tail) did  not  yet appear.  But
 afterwards  (says  Aristotle), when  the splendour  of the  tail was  now  dimin
 ished  (the head  of), the comet  recovered  its native  brightness.  And  the
splendour  of its tail reached  now  to a third  part  of the heavens  (that  is, to

60°).  It appeared  in the winter  season,  and, rising  to Orion's  girdle,  there
vanished away."  Two  comets  of  the same  kind  are described  by Justin,
 Lib.  37, which,  according  to his account,  " shined  so bright,  that  the whole
heaven  seemed  to be on  fire ; and  by  their  greatness  filled up  a fourth  part
of  the  heavens, and  by their  splendour  exceeded  that  of  the sun."  By
which  last words  a near  position  of  these  bright  comets  and  the rising  or
setting  sun  is intimated  (p. 494, 495).  We  may  add  to these  the comet  of
 the year 1101  or 1106,  " the  star  of which  was  small  and  obscure  (like that
of  ] 6SO) ; but  the splendour  arising from  it extremely  bright, reaching  like
a  fiery beam  to the  east  and  north,"  as Hevelius  has  it from  Simeon,  the
monk  of Durham.   It appeared  at  the beginning  of February  about  the
evening  in the south-west.  From  this and  from  the  situation  of  the  tail
we may  infer  that  the head  was  near  the sun.  Matthew  Paris  says,  "it
was  about  one  cubit from  the  sun ; from  the  third  [or rather  the sixth]  to
 the ninth  hour  sending  out  a long stream  of light."  The  comet  of  1264,
 in July,  or about  the  solstice, preceded  the  rising  sun, sending  out  its beams
with  a great  light towards  the  west  as far  as the middle  of  the  heavens  ;
and  at the beginning  it ascended  a little above  the horizon  : but  as the sun
went  forwards  it retired  every day  farther  from  the  horizon,  till it passed
by the very  middle  of the heavens.  It is said  to have  been  at the beginning
large and  bright, having  a large coma,  which  decayed  from  day  to day.  It
 is described  in Append.  Matth,  Paris,  Hist.  Aug.  after  this manner  : ^Au.
 Christi  1265,  there appeared  a comet  so wonderful,  that  none  then  living
had  ever  seen  the  like ; for, rising from  the  east with  a great  brightness,  it
extended  itself \uth  a  great  light  as far  as the middle  of  the  hemisphere
towards  the west."  The  Latin  original  being somewhat  barbarous  and  ob-
gcure,  it is here subjoined.  Ah  oriente  enim  cum  tnaguo  fulgore  sur-

                             THE   SYSTEM      OF   THE WORLD.       553


  "In  the year 1401  or 1402,  the sun  being  got below  the horizon,  there
appeared  in the  west  a bright  and  shining  comet,  sending  out  a tail up
wards,  in splendor  like  a flame  of  fire, and  in form  like  a spear, darting  its
rays from  west  to east. When   the  sun  was  sunk  below  the horizon,  by the
lustre  of  its own  rays  it enlightened  all the  borders  of  the  earth,  not  per
mitting  the  other  stars  to shew  their  light,  or the shades  of night  to darken
the  air, because  its light exceeded  that  of the  others, and  extended  itself  to

the upper  part  of  the  heavens,  flaming,"  &c., Hist. Byzaut.  Due.  Mich.
Nepot.  From  the situation  of  the  tail of  this  comet,  and  the time  of  its
first appearance,  we may  infer that  the  head  was  then  near  the  sun,  and
went  farther  from  him  every day ; for that comet  continued  three months.
In the year  1527, Aug.  11, about  four  in  the morning,  there  was  seen  al
most  throughout  Europe  a terrible comet  in Leo, which  continued  flaming
an hour  and  a quarter  every day.  It rose from  the  east, and  ascended  to
the south  and  west  to  a prodigious  length.  It was  most  conspicuous  to the
north, and  its cloud  (that  is, its  tail) was  very  terrible ; having,  according
to the fancies  of  the  vulgar,  the form  of  an  arm  a little bent  holding  a
sword  of  a  vast magnitude.  In  the year  1618,  in the  end  of November,
there began  a rumour,  that  there  appeared  about  sun-rising  a bright  beam,
which  was  the  tail of  a comet  whose  head  was  yet  concealed  within  the
brightness  of  the  solar rays.  On  Nov.  24, and  from  that  time,  the comet
itself appeared  with  a bright  light,  its head  and  tail being extremely  re
splendent.  The  length  of  the  tail, which  was  at  first 20  or 30  dog., in
creased  till December  9, when  it arose  to 75  deg,, but  with  a light much
more  faint  and  dilute  than  at the beginning.  In the year  1668, March  5,
N.  S., about  7 in the evening,  P.  Volent.  Estaucius,  being  in Brazil,  saw
a comet  near  the  horizon  in  the south-west.  Its head  was  small,  and
scarcely  discernible,  but  its tail extremely  bright  and  refulgent,  so that  the
reflection  of  it from  the  sea  was  easily  seen by those who  stood  upon  the
shore.  This  great  splendor  lasted  but  three  days, decreasing  very remark
ably from  that time.  The  tail at the beginning  extended  itself from  west
to south, and  in  a situation  almost  parallel  to the horizon,  appearing  like
a shining beam  23  deg. in length.  Afterwards,  the  light  decreasing,  its
magnitude  increased  till the comet  ceased  to be  visible;  so that  Cassiid,
at Bologna^  saw  it (Mar.  10, 11, 12) rising from  the  horizon  32  deg. in
length.  In Portugal  it is said  to have  taken  up  a fourth  part of  the
heavens  (that  is, 45  deg.), extending  itself from  west  to  east with  a notable
brightness ; though  the whole  of  it was  not  seen, because  the head  in this
part  of the world  always  lay hid  below  the horizon.  From  the increase  of
the  tail  it is plain  that  the head  receded  from  the  sun.  and  was  nearest  to
it at the beginning,  when  the  tail appeared  brightest.
  To  all these  we may  add  the  comet  of  1680,  whose  wonderful  splendor
at the conjunction  of the  head  with  the sun  was  above  described.  Hut  so

great  a splendor  argues  the comets  of  this  kind  to have  really passed  near
the fountain  of  light, especially  since  the  tails never  shine  so much  in
their opposition  to the  sun  j nor  do we  read  that  fiery beams  have  ever  ap
peared  there.
   Lastly,  the same  thing  is inferred  (p. 466; 407) from  the  light  of  the
heads  increasing  in  the  recess  of the  comets  from  the earth  towards  the
sun,  and  decreasing  in their  return  from  the sun  towards  the  earth ; for  so
the  last comet  of the year  1 665  (by the observation  of Hevelius]^  from  the
time  that  it was  first seen,  was  always  losing  of  its apparent  motion,  and
therefore  had  already  passed  its perigee  : yet  the splendor  of  its head  was

daily increasing,  till, being  hid  by the sun?s  rays, the  comet  ceased  to ap
pear.  The  comet  of  the year  (683  (by the observation  of  the same  He-
jelius), about  the  end  of July, when  it first appeared, moved   at  a very

slow  rate, advancing  only about  40  or 45 minutes  in  its orbit  in a day's
time.  I3ut from  that time  its diurnal  motion  was  continually  upon  the
increase  till Septe/uber  4, when  it arose  to  about  5 degrees  ; and  therefore
in  all this interval  of time  the comet  was  approaching  to the earth. Which
is likewise  proved  from  the diameter  of its head  measured  with  a microme

ter ; for, August  the  6th, Hevelius  found  it only  6'  5", including  the
coma  ; which,  September  2, he  observed  9' 7".  And  therefore  its head
appeared  far  less about  the beginning  than  towards  the end  of  its motion,
though  about  the  beginning,  because  nearer  to  the sun,  it appeared  far
more  lucid  than  towards  the end,  as  the same  Hevelius  declares.  Where
fore  in  all this  interval  of  time,  on account  of  its recess from  the  sun,
it decreased  in splendor, notwithstanding   its access  towards  the earth.  The
comet  of  the  year  1618,  about  the  middle  of December,  and  that  of  the
year  1680, about  the  end  of  the same  month,  did  both  move  with  their
greatest  velocity,  and  were  therefore  then  in their  perigees  : but  the greatest
splendor  of  their  heads  was  seen  two  weeks  before, when  they  had  just got

clear  of  the  sun's  rays  : and  the  greatest  splendor  of  their  tuild a  little
more  early, when  yet nearer  to  the sun.  The  head  of  the  former  comet,
according  to the observations  of  Cysattis,  Dec.  1, appeared  greater  than
 the  stars  of the  first magnitude:  and, Dec.  16 (being  then  in its perigee),
•)i a small  magnitude,  and  the splendor  or clearness  was  much  diminished.
Jan.  7, Kepler,  being  uncertain  about  the head?  left off observing.  Dec.
 12, the head  of  the  last comet  was  seen  and  observed  by Flamxted  at the
distance  of 9 degrees from  the  sun, which  a star of  the  third magnitude
could  hardly  have been.  December  15 and  17, the same  appeared  like  a
 star  of the  third  magnitude,  its splendor  being diminished  by the bright
clouds  near  the setting sun.  Dec.  26, when  it moved  with  the  greatest
swiftness, and  was  almost  in  its perigee,  it was  inferior  to Os  Pegasi,  a
 star  of the  third magnitude.   Jait.  3, it appeared  like  a star  of the fourth   :

brightness  of  the moon,  which  was  then  in its increase.  Jan.  25,  it was
scarcely  equal  to the  stars  of the  seventh  magnitude.  If we  take  equal
times  on  each  hand  of  the  perigee, the  heads  placed  at remote  distances
would  have  shined  equally  before  and  after, because  of their equal  distances
frjin  the  earth.  That  in  one  case  they shined  very  bright, and  in the
other  vanished,  is to be ascribed  to the  nearness  cf the sun  in the  first case,
and  his distance  in the other;  and  from  the great  difference  of  the light
in  these  two  cases  we  infer  its great  nearness  in the  first of them  : for
the  light  of the  comets  uses  to be regular, and  to appear  greatest when
their heads  move  the  swiftest, and  are  therefore  in their  perigees  ; except
ing  in so fur  as  it is increased  by their  nearness  to the  sun.
  From  the«e  things  I at last discovered  why  the comets  frequent  so much
the region  of the sun.  If they  were  to be seen  in  the regions  a great way
beyond  Saturn,  they must  appear  oftener  in  these  parts  of the  heavens
that  are  opposite  to the  sun  ; for those  which  are  in  that  situation  would
be nearer  to the  earth, and  the interposition  of  the sun  would  obscure  the
others:  but, looking  over  the  history  of comets,  I find that  four  or  five

times  more  have  been  seen  in the hemisphere  towards  the sun  than  in  th-3
opposite  hemisphere  ; besides, without  doubt,  not  a  few which  have  been
hid by the light of  the sun ; fur comets  descending  into our  parts  neither
emit  tails, nor  are  so  well  illuminated  by the  sun,  as to discover  them
selves  to our  naked  eyes,  till they  are come  nearer  to us  than Jupiter.  But
the  far greater  part  of  that  spherical  space, which  is described  about  the
sun  with  so small  an  interval,  lies en  that  side  of  the earth  which  regards
the  sun, and  the comets  in that  greater  part  are more  strongly  illuminated,
as being  for the most  part nearer  to the  sun  : besides, from  the remarka
ble eccentricity  of  their  orbits, it comes  to  pass that  their  lower  apsides
are much  nearer  to the  sun  than  if their  revolutions  were  performed  in
circles concentric  to the  sun.

   Hence  also  we  understand  why  the  tails  of the comets,  while  their heads
 are descending  towards  the  sun, always  appear  short  and  rare, and  are  sel
dom  said  to have  exceeded  15  or  20  deg. in length  ; but  in  the recess  of
 the heads  from  the sun  often  shine  like  fiery beams,  and  soon  after  reach
 to 40, 50, 60, 70  deg. in length,  or more.  This  great  splendor  and  length
 of  the  tails  arises from  the  heat which  the sun  communicates  to  the comet

 as  it passes  near it.  And  thence,  I think,  it may  be concluded,  that  all the
 comets  that have  had  such  tails have  passed  very  near  the  sun.
   Hence  also we  may  collect  that  the  tails  arise from  the  atmospheres  of
 the heads  (p. 487  to 488) : but  we have  had  three  several  opinions  about
 the  tails of comets  ; for some  will  have  it that  they  are nothing  else but

 the beams  of  the  sun's  light transmitted  through  the comets'  heads, which
 they suppose  to be transparent  ; others,  that  they  proceed  from  the  refrac

 tion which  light  suffers  in passing  from  the comet's  head  to the earth  ;

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| would have | shined | equally be | fore and after, beca | use of their equ | al distances |
| frjin the | earth. | That in | one case they shin | ed very bright, | and in the |
| other vanis | hed, is | to be ascrib | ed to the nearness | cf the sun in t | he first case, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and his dis | tance i | n the other; | and from the gr | eat difference | of the light |
| in these t | wo case | s we infer | its great nearness | in the first of | them : for |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the light | of the | comets use | s to be regular, an | d to appear gr | eatest when |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| their heads | move | the swiftest, | and are therefore | in their perige | es ; except |
| ing in so f | ur as it | is increase | d by their nearness | to the sun. |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| From th | e«e thi | ngs I at last | discovered why th | e comets freque | nt so much |
| the region | of the | sun. If th | ey were to be seen | in the regions | a great way |
| beyond Sa | turn, t | hey must a | ppear oftener in | these parts of | the heavens |
| that are op | posite | to the sun ; | f or those which ar | e in that situ | ation would |
| be nearer t | o the ea | rth, and th | e interposition of | the sun would | obscure the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| others: but | , looki | ng over th | e history of comet | s, I find that | four or five |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| times more | have b | een seen in | the hemisphere t | owards the sun | than in th-3 |
| opposite h | emispher | e ; b esides, | without doubt, n | ot a few which | have been |
| hid by the | light o | f the sun ; | f ur comets descend | ing into our p | arts neither |
| emit tails, | nor ar | e so well | illuminated by the | sun, as to dis | cover them |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| selves to o | ur naked | eyes, till | they are come neare | r to us than Ju | piter. But |
| the far gre | ater pa | rt of that | spherical space, wh | ich is describe | d about the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| sun with s | o small | an interval, | lies en that side | of the earth wh | ich regards |
| the sun, an | d the c | omets in tha | t greater part are | more strongly | illuminated, |
| as being f | or the m | ost part n | earer to the sun : | besides, from t | he remarka |

| are much | nearer | to the sun | than if their revo | lutions were p | erformed in |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Hence a | lso we | understand | why the tails of th | e comets, while | their heads |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| are descen | ding to | wards the s | un, always appear | short and rare, | and are sel |
| dom said | to have | exceeded | 15 or 20 deg. in le | ngth ; b ut in | the recess of |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| to 40, 50, | 60, 70 | deg. in leng | th, or more. This | great splendor | and length |
| of the tail | s arises | from the h | eat which the sun | communicates t | o the comet |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| as it passe | s near i | t. And the | nce, I think, it may | be concluded, | that all the |

and,  lastly, others,  that  they  are  a  sort  of clouds  or  vapour  constantly

rising from  the  cornets'  heads, and  tending  towards  the parts opposite  to
the sun.  The   first is the opinion  of such  as  are  yet unacquainted  with
optics ; for the beams  of  the sun  are not  seen  in a darkened  room,  but  in
consequence  of the  light  that  is reflected from  them  by the  little  particles
of  dust  and smoke  which  are always  flying about  in the  air ; and  hence  it
is that  in  air impregnated  with  thick  smoke  they appear  with  greater
brightness,  and  are more  faintly and  more  difficultly seen  in a  finer  air;
but  in the heavens,  where  there  is no  matter  to reflect  the  light, they  are
not  to be seen  at all.  Light  is not  seen  as  it is in the beams,  but  as  it  is
thence  reflected  to  our  eyes ; for  vision  is not made  but by rays  falling
upon  the  eyes, and  therefore  there  must  be some  reflecting matter  in those
parts where  the  tails of comets  are  seen  ; and  so the argument  turns  upon
the  third  opinion  ; for  that  reflecting  matter  can  be no where  found  but  in
the place  of the  tail, because  otherwise,  since  all the  celestial  spaces  are

equally  illuminated  by the  sun's  light, no  part  of the heavens  could  appear
with  more  splendor  than another.  The  second  opinion  is liable  to many
difficulties. The  tails  of comets  are  never  seen  variegated  with  thos-e
colours  which  ever  use  to be inseparable  from  refraction  ; and  the  distinct
transmission  of  the light of  the  fixed  stars  and  planets  to us  is a demon
stration  that  the  aether  or celestial medium   is not endowed  with  any  re
fractive power.  For  as  to what  is alledged  that  the  fixed  stars have  been
sometimes  seen by the Egyptians  environed  with  a coma   or capillitium
because  that  has  but  rarely happened,  it is rather  to be ascribed  to a casual
refraction  of clouds,  as  well  as the radiation  and  scintillation  of the  fixed
stars  to  the refractions  both  of the  eyes and  air ; for upon  applying  a tele
scope  to the  eye, those  radiations  and  scintillations  immediately  disappear.
By  the tremulous  agitation  of the  air and  ascending  vapours,  it happens
that  the rays  of light  are  alternately  turned  aside  from  the narrow  space
of  the pupil  of  the  eye ; but  no such  thing  can  have  place  in the much
wider  aperture  of  the object-glass  of a  telescope  ; and  hence  it is that  a
scintillation  is occasioned  in the former  case  which  ceases  in the  latter ;
and  this cessation  in the  latter  case  is a demonstration  of the regular  trans
mission  of light through  the  heavens  without  any  sensible  refraction.
But,  to obviate  an  objection  that may  be made  from  the appearing  of  no
tail in such  comets  as shine  but  with  a faint  light, as if the secondary
rays  were  then  too weak  to affect  the  eyes, and  for  this  reason  it is that
the  tails of  the  fixed  stars do  not  appear,  we  are  to consider  that by the
means  of  telescopes  the  light of  the fixed  stars may  be augmented  above
an hundred  fold and  yet no  tails  are seen;  that  the light of  the planets  is
yet more  copious  without  any  tail, but  that comets  are  seen  sometimes
with huge  tails when  the light  of  their heads  is but  faint  and  dull ; for
so  it happened  in the comet  of the  year  1680, when  in the month  of De-

| and, lastly, othe | rs, that the | y are a s | ort of clouds | or vapour | constantly |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rising from the | cornets' hea | ds, and te | nding towards | the parts | opposite to |
| the sun. The | first is the o | pinion of | such as are | yet unacqua | inted with |
| optics ; f or the | beams of the | sun are n | ot seen in a | darkened r | oom, but in |
| consequence of | the light tha | t is reflect | ed from them | by the litt | le particles |
| of dust and smo | ke which ar | e always f | lying about in | the air ; a | nd hence it |
| is that in air | impregnated | with thic | k smoke the | y appear w | ith greater |
| brightness, and | are more fai | ntly and | more difficult | ly seen in | a finer air; |
| but in the heave | ns, where t | here is no | matter to refl | ect the ligh | t, they are |
| not to be seen a | t all. Ligh | t is not se | en as it is in | the beams, | but as it is |
| thence reflected | to our eye | s ; f or vi | sion is not ma | de but by | rays falling |
| upon the eyes, a | nd therefore | there must | be some refl | ecting matt | er in those |
| parts where the | tails of com | ets are see | n ; and so the | argument | turns upon |
| the third opinio | n ; f or that | reflecting | matter can be | no where f | ound but in |
| the place of the | tail, because | otherwise | , since all t | he celestial | spaces are |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| equally illumina | ted by the | sun's light, | no part of th | e heavens c | ould appear |
| with more splen | dor than an | other. Th | e second op | inion is liab | le to many |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| difficulties. Th | e tails of | comets are | never seen | variegated | with thos-e |
| colours which e | ver use to be | inseparabl | e from refrac | tion ; and | the distinct |
| transmission of | the light of | the fixed | stars and pla | nets to us | is a demon |
| stration that th | e aether or | celestial m | edium is not | endowed w | ith any re |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| fractive power. | For as to | what is all | edged that th | e fixed star | s have been |
| sometimes seen | by the Egyp | tians en | vironed with | a coma or | capillitium |
| because that has | but rarely | happened, | it is rather to | be ascribed | to a casual |
| refraction of clo | uds, as well | as the rad | iation and sc | intillation o | f the fixed |
| stars to the refr | actions both | of the eye | s and air ; f or | upon appl | ying a tele |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| scope to the eye, | those radia | tions and | scintillations | immediately | disappear. |
| By the tremulou | s agitation | of the air | and ascendin | g vapours, | it happens |
| that the rays of | light are a | lternately | turned aside | from the na | rrow space |
| of the pupil of | the eye ; b u | t no such | thing can h | ave place i | n the much |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| wider aperture | of the objec | t-glass of | a telescope ; | and hence | it is that a |
| scintillation is | occasioned i | n the form | er case whic | h ceases in | the latter ; |
| and this cessatio | n in the latt | er case is a | demonstratio | n of the re | gular trans |
| mission of ligh | t through | the heaven | s without a | ny sensible | refraction. |
| But, to obviate | an objection | that may | be made fro | m the appea | ring of no |
| tail in such com | ets as shin | e but wit | h a faint ligh | t, as if the | secondary |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| rays were then | too weak to | affect the | eyes, and for | this reason | it is that |
| the tails of the | fixed stars | do not app | ear, we are t | o consider | that by the |
| means of telesc | opes the ligh | t of the fi | xed stars may | be augme | nted above |
| an hundred fold | and yet no | tails are s | een; that the | light of th | e planets is |
| yet more copio | us without | any tail, | but that come | ts are seen | sometimes |
| with huge tails | when the li | ght of the | ir heads is bu | t faint an | d dull ; f or |
| so it happened i | n the comet | of the ye | ar 1680, when | in the mon | th of De- |

cember  it was  scarcely  equal  in light  to the  stars  of the second  magnitude

and  yet emitted  a notable  tail, extending  to the length  of  40°, 50°,  60°.  or
70°, and  upwards  ; and  afterwards,  on  the 27th  and  28th  of January,  the
head  appeared  but  as  a  star  of  the seventh  magnitude  ; but  the  tail  (as
was  said  above), with  a light  that was  sensible  enough,  though  faint, was
stretched  out  to 6 or 7 degrees  in  length,  and  with  a languishing  light

that  was  more  difficultly  seen,  even  to 12° and  upwards.  But  on  the 9th
and  10th  of February,  when  to the naked  eye  the head  appeared  no  more,

I saw  through  a  telescope  the  tail of 2° in length.  But  farther : if the
tail  was  owing  to  the refraction  of the  celestial  matter,  and  did deviate
from  the opposition  of  the  sun, according  as the  figure of  the heavens  re
quires,  that  deviation,  in the same  places  of  the heavens,  should  be always
directed  towards  the same  parts  : but  the comet  of  the year  1680, Decem
ber  28'1. SJ1'. P. M.  at London,  was  seen  in Pisces,  8°  41', with  latitude
north  28°  6', while  the sun  was  in Capricorn  18° 26'.  And  the comet  of
the  year  1577, December  29, was  in Pisces  8°  41', with  latitude  north
2SD  40'  ; and  the  sun,  as before, in about  Capricorn  18°  26'.  In  both
cases  the situation  of  the earth  was  the same,  and  the comet  appeared  in
the same  place  of the heavens  ; yet in the former  case  the  tail of the comet
(as well by my  observations  as by the  observations  of others)  deviated
from  the opposition  of  the sun  towards  the  north  by an  angle  of 4|  de
grees, whereas  in  the  latter  there  was  (according  to  the observation  of
Tycht]  a  deviation  of 21  degrees  towards  the south.  The  refraction,
therefore,  of the heavens  being  thus  disproved,  it remains  that  the phaeno-
meria  of  the  tails of comets  must  be  derived  from  some  reflecting  matter.
That  vapours  sufficient  to  fill such  immense  spaces may  arise  from  the

comet's  atmospheres,  may  be  easily understood  from  what  follows.
   It is well known  that  the  air near  the  surface  of  our  earth  possesses  a
space  about  1200  times  greater  than  water  of the same  weight  ; and  there
fore  a cylindric  column  of  air 1200  feet high  is of  equal weight  with  a
cylinder  of  water  of  the same  breadth,  and  but  one  foot high.  But  a
cylinder  of  air reaching  to  the top of  the atmosphere  is of  equal weight
with  a cylinder  of  water  about  33  feet  high  ; and  therefore  if from  the
whole  cylinder  of  air the lower  part of 1200  feet high  is taken  away,  the
remaining  upper  part  will  be of equal weight  with  a cylinder  of water  32
feet high.  Wherefore  at  the height  of 1200  feet, or two  furlongs,  the
weight  of  the incumbent  air  is less, and  consequently  the  rarity of  the
compressed  air greater,  than  near  the  surface  of the  earth  in the  ratio  of
33  to 32.  And,  having  this  ratio, we  may  compute  the  rarity  of  the  air
in  all places whatsoever  (by the  help  of  Cor.  Prop. XXII,  Book  II), sup
posing  the expansion  thereof  to be reciprocally  proportional  to  its compres
sion  ; and  this proportion  has  been  proved  by the  experiments  of Hooke
and  others.  The  result  of the computation  I have  set down  in the follow-

   But  from  this  table  it appears  that  the  air, in proceeding  upwards,   is
rarefied  in such  manner,  that  a  sphere  of that  air which  is nearest  to the
earth, of but one inch  in diameter,  if dilated  with  that  rarefaction  which
it would  have  at the height  of one  semi-diameter  of the  earth, would   fill all
the planetary  regions  as far  as the  sphere  of  Saturn,  and  a great way  be
yond  ; and  at the height  of  ten semi-diameters  of  the  earth  would   fill up
more  space  than  is contained  in  the whole  heavens  on  this  side  the  fixed
stars, according  to the  preceding  computation  of  their  distance.  And
though,  by reason  of the  far greater  thickness  of the atmospheres  of comets,
and  the great  quantity  of the circum-solar  centripetal  force,  it may  happen
that  the  air in the  celestial  spaces, and  in the  tails of  comets,  is not  so
vastly  rarefied, yet from  this computation  it  ^s plain  that  a very  small
quantity  of air and vapour  is abundantly  sufficient  to produce  all the ap
pearances  of the  tails  of comets;  for that  they  are indeed  of  a very  notable
rarity appears  from  the shining  of  the  stars  through  them.  The  atmos
phere  of the earth, illuminated  by the sun's  light, though  but  of a few  miles
in thickness,  obscures  arid extinguishes  the  light  not  only  of  all the  stars,
but  even  of the moon  itself; whereas  the  smallest  stars  are  seen  to shine
through  the immense  thickness  of the  tails  of comets,  likewise  illuminated
by the sun, without  the  least diminution  of  their  splendor.
   Kepler  ascribes  the ascent  of  the  tails of  comets  to the atmospheres  of
their  heads, and  their direction  towards  the  parts opposite  to the sun  to the
action  of the  rays  of  light carrying  along with  them  the  matter  of  the

of the  rays  of the sun's  light, though  those  rays  are  not  able sensibly  to move
the gross  substances  in our  parts, which  are  clogged  with  so palpable  a  re
sistance.  Another  author  thinks  that  there may  be  a  sort of  particles  of
matter  endowed  with  a  principle  of  levity  as  well  as  others  are  with  a
power  of  gravity  ; that  the matter  of  the  tails of comets  may  be of  the
former  sort, and  that  its ascent  from  the  sun  may  be owing  to  its levity ;
but, considering  the gravity  of  terrestrial  bodies  is as  the matter  of  the
bodies, and  therefore  can  be neither  more  nor  less in the same  quantity  of
matter,  I am  inclined  to believe  that  this  ascent  may  rather  proceed  from
the rarefaction  of the matter  of the comets'  tails.  The  ascent  of smoke  in
a chimney  is owing  to the impulse  of  the  air with  which  it is entangled.
The  air rarefied  by heat  ascends,  because  its specific gravity  is diminished,
and  in  its ascent  carries  along  with  it the smoke  with  which  it is engaged.
/Vnd why  may  not  the  tail of  a comet  rise from  the  sun  after  the same

manner?   for  the  sun's  rays do  not  act  any  way  upon  the mediums  which
they pervade  but by reflection  and  refraction  ; and  those  reflecting  parti
cles heated  by  this  action,  heat  the matter  of  the  aether which  is involved
with them.  That  matter  is rarefied  by  the  heat which  it acquires,  and
because  by  this  rarefaction  the  specific gravity,  with  which  it tended
towards  the sun  before,  is diminished,  it will ascend  therefrom  like  a stream,
and  carry  along  with  it the  reflecting  particles  of which  the  tail  of  the

comet  is composed  ; the impulse  of  the  sun's  light,  as we  have  said, pro
moting  the ascent.             •
   But  that  the  tails  of comets  do  arise from  their heads  (p. 488), and  tend
towards  the parts opposite  to  the  sun,  is farther  confirmed  from  the laws

which  the  tails observe ; for, lying  in the planes  of the comets'  orbits which
pass through  the sun, they constantly  deviate  from  the  opposition  of  the

sun  towards  the  parts which  the comets'  heads  in their  progress  along  those
orbits have  left ; and  to  a spectator  placed  in  those  planes  they appear  in
the parts directly opposite  to  the  sun ; but  as  the  spectator  recedes  from
those  planes,  their  deviation  begins  to  appear,  and  daily becomes  greater.
And  the deviation,  c&teris  paribits,  appears  less when  the  tail  is more  ob
lique  to the  orbit  of the  comet,  as well  as when  the head  of the comet  ap
proaches  nearer  to the  sun  .; especially  if the angle  of deviation  is estimated
near  the head  of the comet.  Farther;  the  tails which  have  no deviation
appear  straight,  but  the  tails which  deviate  are likewise  bended  into  a  cer
tain curvature  ; and  this curvature  is greater when  the deviation  is greater,
and  is more  sensible when  the  tail, cccteris paribus,  is longer;  for in the
shorter  tails the curvature  is hardly  to be  perceived.  And  the angle  of

deviation  is less near  the  comet's  head,  but  greater  towards  the  other  end
of  the  tail, and  that  because  the lower  side of  the  tail regards  the parts
from  which  the deviation  is made,  and  which  lie in  a right  line drawn  out
infinitely from  the sun through  the  comet's  head.  And  the  tails that  are

| matter end | owed | with a princi | ple of levity | as well a | s others | are with a |
| power of g | ravit | y ; that the mat | ter of the t | ails of co | mets may | be of the |
| former sort | , and | that its ascent | from the su | n may be | owing to | its levity |
| but, consid | ering | the gravity of | terrestrial b | odies is a | s the mat | ter of the |
| bodies, and | ther | efore can be nei | ther more no | r less in t | he same | quantity of |
| matter, I a | m in | clined to believe | that this as | cent may | rather pr | oceed from |
| the rarefac | tion | of the matter of | the comets' | tails. The | ascent o | f smoke in |
| a chimney | is ow | ing to the impu | lse of the a | ir with wh | ich it is | entangled. |
| The air ra | refied | by heat ascends | , because its | specific gr | avity is | diminished, |
| and in its | ascent | carries along | with it the sm | oke with | which it | is engaged. |
| /Vnd why m | ay n | ot the tail of | a comet rise | from the | sun afte | r the same |

| because by | this | rarefaction t | he specific gr | avity, wit | h which | it tended |
| towards th | e sun | before, is dimini | shed, it will a | scend ther | efrom lik | e a stream, |

| But that | the | tails of comets | do arise from | their head | s (p. 4 88) | , and tend |
| towards the | part | s opposite to t | he sun, is fa | rther conf | irmed fr | om the laws |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| which the | tails | observe ; f or, ly | ing in the pla | nes of the | comets' o | rbits which |
| pass throug | h th | e sun, they cons | tantly deviat | e from th | e opposit | ion of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| appear stra | ight, | but the tails w | hich deviate | are likewise | bended | into a cer |

| and is more | sen | sible when the | tail, cccteris | paribus, i | s longer; | for in the |

longer  and  broader;  and  shine  with  a stronger  light, appear  more  resplendent
and  more  exactly  defined  on  the  convex  than  on  the concave  side.  Upon
which  accounts  it is plain  that  the phenomena  of the  tails of comet?  de
pend  upon  the motions  of their  heads,  and  by no means  upon  the places  of
the heavens  in which  their heads  are  seen  ; and  that, therefore,  the  tailg of
the comets  do  not  proceed  from  the  refraction  of  the  heavens,  but from
their own  heads, which  furnish  the matter  that  forms  the  tail ; for as in
our  air the smoke  of a heated  body  ascends  either  perpendicularly,  if the
body  is at  rest, or  obliquely  if the body  is moved  obliquely,  so  in the
heavens,  where  all the  bodies  gravitate  towards  the sun, smoke  and  vapour
must  (as we  have  already  said) ascend  from  the  sun, and  either  rise perpen
dicularly,  if the smoking  body  is  at  rest, or  obliquely,  if  the body,  in the
progress  of its motion,  is always  leaving  those  places from  which  the upper
or higher  parts  of  the  vapours  had  risen before.  And  that  obliquity  will
be  less where  the vapour  ascends  with  more  velocity,  to  wit, near  the
smoking  body, when  that  is near  the  sun  ; for there  the  force  of the sun by
which  the vapour  ascends  is stronger.  But  because  the obliquity  is varied,
the column  of vapour  will  be  incurvated  ; and  because  the vapour  in the
preceding  side  is something  more  recent,  that  is, has  ascended  something
more  lately from  the body,  it will  therefore  be something  more  dense  on
that  side, and  must  on  that  account  reflect more  light,  as  well  as be better
defined ; the vapour  on  the  other  side languishing  by degrees,  and  vanish
ing out  of  sight.
   But  it is none  of  our  present  business  to explain  the  causes  of  the ap
pearances  of nature.  Let  those  things  which  we  have  last said  be true  or
false, we  have  at least made  out, in the  preceding  discourse,  that  the rays
of light  are  directly propagated  from  the  tails  of comets  in right  lines
through  the heavens,  in which  those  tails appear  to  the spectators  wherever
placed  ; and consequently  the  tails must  ascend  from  the heads  of the comets
towards  the  parts  opposite  to  the sun.  And  from  this principle  we may
                                     determine  anew  the  limits  of  their  dis-

 <~                  tances  in manner  following.    Let  S rep-
                                      resent  the  sun, T  the  earth, STA   the
                                      elongation  of  a comet  from  the  sun, and
                            ATB  the apparent  length  of  its  tail;
                                        and  because  the light  is propagated  from
                                           the extremity  of the  tail in the direction
                                      of  the  right, line TB,  that  extremity
                                 must  lie somewhere  in  the  line TB.

| pend upon the | motions | of their | heads, | and by no mean | s upon t | he places of |
| the heavens in | which t | heir heads | are s | een ; and that, | therefore, | the tailg of |
| the comets do | not pro | ceed from | the | refraction of t | he heavens | , but from |
| their own heads | , which | furnish | the ma | tter that form | s the tail | ; f or as in |
| our air the smo | ke of a | heated | body a | scends either pe | rpendicula | rly, if the |
| body is at res | t, or ob | liquely i | f the | body is moved | obliquely | , so in the |
| heavens, where | all the | bodies gra | vitate | towards the su | n, smoke | and vapour |
| must (as we ha | ve alread | y said) a | scend | from the sun, a | nd either | rise perpen |
| dicularly, if th | e smoki | ng body | is at r | est, or obliquely | , if the b | ody, in the |

the sun,  the head  of the comet,  and  the extremity  of the  tail, lie in  a right
line, the comet's  head  will  be found  in C.  Parallel  to TB  draw  SA,  meet
ing the  line TA   in A, arid  the  comet's  head C  must  necessarily  be found
between  T  and  A, because  the extremity  of  the  tail  lies somewhere  in the
infinite  line TB  ; and  all the  lines  SI)  which  can  possibly  be drawn  from
the point S  to the line TB  must  cut  the  line TA  somewhere  between T
and A.  Wherefore  the distance  of the comet  from  the earth  cannot  exceed
the interval TA.  nor  its distance  from  the  sun  the interval SA  beyond,  or
ST  on  this  side the sun.  For  instance  : the  elongation  of  the  comet  of

16SO  from  the sun, Dec.  12, was  9°, and  the length  of its tail 35°  at least.
If, therefore,  a triangle TSA   is made,  whose  angle T  is equal  to the  elon

gation  9°, and  angle A  equal  to ATB,   or to the length  of the  tail, viz., 35°,
then SA  will  be  to ST,  that  is, the  limit  of  the  greatest  possible  distance

of  the comet  from  the  sun  to the  semi -diameter  of  the  oj-bis ma  gnus,  as
the  sine of  the angle T  to  the  sine  of the  angle A, that  is, as about  3  to
11.  And  therefore  the comet  at  that time  was  less distant  from  the sun

than  by  T3T of  the  earth's  distance  from  the  sun,  and  consequently  either
was  within  the  orb  of Mercury,  or between  that  orb and  the earth.  Again,

Dec.  21, the elongation  of the comet  from  the  sun  was  32f °, and  the length
of its tail 70°.  Wherefore  as the  sine of 3^|°  to the  sine of 70°, that  is,
as 4 to 7, so was  the limit  of  the comet's  distance  from  the sun  to the  dis
tance  of  the  earth  from  the  sun, and  consequently  the comet  had  not  then
got without  the orb  of Venus.  Dec.  28, the elongation  of  the comet  from

the  sun  was  55°, and  the length  of  its tail 56° ; and  therefore  the  limit  of
the comet's  distance  from  the sun  was  not  yet equal  to the distance  of  the
earth  from  the same,  and  consequently  the comet  had  not  then  got without

the  earth's orbit.  But  from  its parallax we  find  that  its egress from  the
orbit happened  about  Jan.  5, as well  as  that  it had  descended  far within
the  orbit of Mercury.  Let  us  suppose  it to have  been  in  its perihelion
Dec.  the  8th, when  it was  in conjunction  with  the sun  ; and  it will  follow
that  in the journey  from  its perihelion  to  its  exit  out  of  the  earth's  orbit
it had  spent 28  days ; and  consequently  that  in  the 26  or 27  days  fol
lowing,  in which  it ceased  to be  farther  seen by  the naked  eye, it had
scarcely doubled  its distance  from  the sun  ; and  by limiting  the distances

 of other  comets  by the  like  arguments,  we  come  'at  last  to  this  conclu
 sion, — that  all comets, during  the  time  in which  they  are  visible  by  us,
 are  within  the  compass  of  a  spherical  space  described  about  the  sun  as  a
 centre,  with  a radius  double,  or  at most  triple, of  the  distance  of the  earth
 from  the  sun.
   And  hence  it follows  that  the comets, during  the  whole  time  of  their
 appearance  unto  us, being  within  the  sphere  of activity  of  the circum
 solar  force, and  therefore  agitated  by the  impulse  of  that  force,  will (by
 Cor.  1, Prop.  XII, Book  I, for  the same  reason  as the planets)  be made   tc

| the interval TA. | nor its dis | tance from | the sun the i | nterval SA b | eyond, or |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 16SO from the s | un, Dec. 12, | was 9°, a | nd the length | of its tail 35° | at least. |
| If, therefore, a t | riangle TSA | is made, | whose angle T | is equal to | the elon |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| gation 9°, and a | ngle A equal | to ATB, | or to the lengt | h of the tail, | viz., 35°, |
| then SA will be | to ST, that | is, t he li | mit of the gre | atest possible | distance |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the comet fr | om the sun | to the semi | -diameter of | the oj-bis ma | gnus, as |
| the sine of the | angle T to | the sine o | f the angle A, | that is, a s a | bout 3 to |
| 11. And theref | ore the come | t at that | time was less | distant from | the sun |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| than by T3T of t | he earth's d | istance fr | om the sun, a | nd consequent | ly either |
| was within the o | rb of Mercu | ry, or betw | een that orb a | nd the earth | . Again, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dec. 21, the elon | gation of t | he comet fr | om the sun was | 32f °, a nd t | he length |
| of its tail 70°. | Wherefore | as the sine | of 3^|° to th | e sine of 70° | , that is, |
| as 4 to 7, so was | the limit | of the come | t's distance fr | om the sun t | o the dis |
| tance of the ear | th from the | sun, and | consequently t | he comet had | not then |
| got without the | orb of Venu | s. Dec. 2 | 8, the elongat | ion of the co | met from |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the sun was 55°, | and the le | ngth of its | tail 56° ; and | therefore th | e limit of |
| the comet's dista | nce from t | he sun was | not yet equal | to the distan | ce of the |
| earth from the | same, and c | onsequently | the comet had | not then go | t without |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the earth's orbit | . But fro | m its para | llax we find t | hat its egress | from the |
| orbit happened | about Jan. | 5, as well | as that it had | descended | far within |
| the orbit of Mer | cury. Let | us suppo | se it to have | been in its | perihelion |
| Dec. the 8th, wh | en it was i | n conjuncti | on with the s | un ; and it w | ill follow |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| that in the jour | ney from it | s perihelion | to its exit o | ut of the ear | th's orbit |
| it had spent 28 | days ; and | consequen | tly that in t | he 26 or 27 | days fol |
| lowing, in which | it ceased | to be far | ther seen by | the naked e | ye, it had |
| scarcely doubled | its distanc | e from the | sun ; and by | limiting the | distances |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of other comets | by the lik | e argument | s, we come 'a | t last to th | is conclu |

move  in conic  sections  that have  one  focus  in  the  centre  of  the  sun, and
by radii drawn  to the sun,  to describe  areas  proportional  to the  times ; for
that  force  is propagated  to an  immense  distance,  and  will govern  the
motions  of bodies  far beyond  the  orbit  of Saturn.
   There  are  three  hypotheses  about  comets  (p. 466) ; for some  will have  it
that  they  are  generated  and  perish  as  often  as they appear  and  vanish  ;
others,  that  they come  from  the regions  of  the  rixed  stars, and  are  seen by
us in their  passage  through  the system  of  our  planets ; and,  lastly, others,
that  they  are bodies  perpetually  revolving  about  the sun  in very  eccentric
orbits.  In  the  first case,  the comets,  according  to their  different  vel  cities,
will move  in conic  sections  of  all sorts;  in the  second, they  will  describe
hyperbolas,  and  in  either  of the  two  will  frequent  indifferently  all quar
ters  of the  heavens,  as  well  those  about  the  poles  as those  towards  the
ecliptic ; in the  third,  their motions  will  be performed  in ellipses very  ec
centric, and  very  nearly approaching  to parabolas.  But  (if the  law  of the
planets  is observed)  their  orbits  will  not much  decline  from  the plane  of
the  ecliptic;  and, so far  as I could  hitherto  observe,  the  third  case  obtains;
for the  comets  do, indeed,  chiefly frequent  the  zodiac, and  scarcely  ever

attain  to a  heliocentric  latitude  of 40°.  And  that  they move  in orbits
 very  nearly  parabolical,  I infer  from  their  velocity ; for  the  velocity  with
which  a parabola  is described  is every  where  to  the velocity  with  which   a
comet  or planet may  be revolved  about  the sun  in  a circle  at the same  dis
 tance  in the  subduplicate  ratio  of 2 to 1 (by Gor.  VII, Prop. XVI)  ; and,
by my  computation,  the  velocity  of comets  is found  to be much  about
 the same.   I examined  the  thing  by inferring  nearly  the  velocities  from
 the  distances,  and  the  distances  both  from  the  parallaxes  and  the phaeno-
 rnena  of  the  tails, and  never  found  the errors  of excess  or defect  in the  ve
 locities  greater than  what  might  have  arose  from  the  errors  in the  dis
 tances  collected  after  that manner.  But  I likewise  made  use  of the  reason

 ing  that  follows.
   Supposing  the  radius  of  the nrbis  magiius  to  be  divided  into  1000
 parts:  let the numbers  in the  first column  of the following  table  represent

 the distance  of  the vertex  of  the parabola  from  the  sun's  centre,  expressed
 by those  parts  : and  a comet  in the  times  expressed  in  col. 2, will  pass
 from  its perihelion  to the surface  of the  spheie  which  is described  about
 the  sun  as a  centre  with  the  radius  of the  orbis magnus  ; and  in the
 times  expressed  in  col. 3, 4, and  5, it will  double,  triple, and  quadruple,
 that  its distance  from   f.l:o sun.

| There are | three | hypotheses abo | ut comets | (p. 466) ; f or | some wi | ll have it |
| that they are | gene | rated and per | ish as oft | en as they a | ppear an | d vanish ; |
| others, that t | hey c | ome from the | regions of | the rixed star | s, and ar | e seen by |
| us in their pa | ssage | through the s | ystem of o | ur planets ; | and, last | ly, others, |
| that they are | bodie | s perpetually | revolving a | bout the sun | in very | eccentric |
| orbits. In th | e firs | t case, the come | ts, accordi | ng to their | different | vel cities, |
| will move in | conic | sections of al | l sorts; in | the second, | they wil | l describe |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| hyperbolas, a | nd in | either of the | two will | frequent indi | fferently | all quar |
| ters of the h | eaven | s, as well tho | se about t | he poles as | those to | wards the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ecliptic ; i n t | he thi | rd, their motio | ns will be | performed | in ellipse | s very ec |
| centric, and v | ery n | early approach | ing to par | abolas. But | (if the | law of the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| planets is obs | erved) | their orbits | will not m | uch decline | from th | e plane of |
| the ecliptic; | and, s | o far as I coul | d hitherto | observe, the | third cas | e obtains; |
| for the comet | s do, | indeed, chiefl | y frequent | the zodiac, | and sca | rcely ever |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| attain to a | helioc | entric latitud | e of 40°. | And that t | hey move | in orbits |

| comet or plan | et ma | y be revolved | about the | sun in a circ | le at the | same dis |

[This  table, here  corrected,  is made  on the  supposition  that  the  earth's
   diurnal  motion   is just 59', and  the measure  of one  minute  loosely 0,2909,
   in respect  of the  radius  1000.  If those  measures  are  taken  true,  the
   true  numbers  of the  table  will  all come  out less.  But  the  difference,

   even when  greatest, and  to  the quadruple  of  the  earth's  distance  from
   the sun, amounts  only  to 16h.  55'.]
  The  time  of  a comet's  ingress  into  the sphere  of  the  orbis magnus,   or
of  its egress from  the same, may  be inferred  nearly  from  its parallax,  bn1

564                         THE   SYSTEM      OF   THE   WORLD.

  The  ingress  01  a  comet  into  the  sphere  of the  orbis magnus,  or  its
egress from  the same, happens  at the time  of  its elongation  from  the  sun,
expressed  in  col. 1, against  its diurnal motion.  So  in the comet  of  1681.

Jan.  4, O.S.  the apparent  diurnal  motion  in its orbit  was  about  3°  5', and
the corresponding  elongation  71 J° ; and  the comet  had  acquired  this  elon
gation from  the sun  Jan.  4, about  six  in Ae  evening.  Again,  in the year
1680,  Nov.  11, the diurnal  motion  of the comet  that  then  appeared  was

about  4|°  ; and  the  corresponding  elongation  79f  happened  Now.  10,  a
little before midnight.  Now  at the  times named  these  comets  had  arrived
at an  equal  distance  from  the sun  with  the  earth, and  the earth  was  then

almost  in its perihelion.  But  the  first table  is fitted  to the  earth's mean
distance  from  the  sun  assumed  of 1000  parts ; and  this distance  is greater
by such  an  excess  of space  as the earth might  describe  by its annual  motion

in one  day's time,  or  the comet  by  its motion  in 16 hours.  To  reduce  the
comet  to  this mean  distance  of 1000  parts, we  add  those  16 hours  to the
former  time, and  subduct  them  from  the  latter  ; and  thus  the former  be

comes  Jan.  4d.  10'1. afternoon  ; the  latter  Nov.  10, about  six in the morn
ing.  But  from  the tenor  and  progress  of  the diurnal  motions  it appears
that  both  comets  were  in conjunction  with  the sun between  Dec.  7 and  Dec.

8 ; and  from  thence  to Jan.  4d. 10h. afternoon  on  one  side, and  to Nov.
10'.  6h. of the morning  on  the  other, there  are  about  28 days.  And   so
many  days  (by Table  1) the motions  in parabolic  trajectories  do require.
   But  though  we  have  hitherto  considered  those  comets  as two,  yet, from
the coincidence  of  their perihelions  and  agreement  of  their  velocities,  it is
probable  that  in  effect  they were  but  one  and  the  same  ; and  if so, the
orbit  of  this comet  must  have  either  been  a  parabola,  or  at least  a conic
section  very  little  differing from  a  parabola, and  at  its vertex  almost  in
contact  with  the surface  of  the sun.  For  (by Tab.  2) the  distance  of  the
comet  from  the  earth, Nov.  10, was  about  360  parts, and  Jan.  4, about
630.  From  which  distances,  together  with  its longitudes  and  latitudes,
we  infer  the distance  of  the places  in which  the comet  was  at those  times
to have  been  about  280  : the  half  of which,  viz., 140,  is an  ordinate  to the

comet's  orbit, cutting  off a  portion  of  its axis  nearly  equal  to the radius
of the  or bis magnus,  that  is, to 1000  parts.  And,  therefore,  dividing  the
square  of  the ordinate  140  by 1000,  the  segment  of  the  axis, we  find  the
latu$ rectum  19, 16, or in a round  number  20 ; the  fourth  part whereof,
5, is the distance  of the vertex  of the  orbit from  the  sun's centre.  But  the
time  corresponding  to the distance  of 5 parts  in Tab.  1 is 27d.  16h. 7'.   Ir.
which  time,  if the comet  moved  in  a parabolic  orbit,  it would  have  been
carried  from  its perihelion  to the surface  of  the sphere  of  the  orbis mag*
nus  described  with  the radius  1000, and  would  have  spent  the double  of
that  time,  viz., 55d.  8|h. in  the whole  course  of  its motion  within  that
sphere  : and  so in fact  it did ; for from  Nov.  10d.  6h. of the morning,  thf

| expressed | in col. 1 | , a gainst i | ts diurna | l motion. So | in the comet | of 1681. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Jan. 4, O. | S. the ap | parent di | urnal mo | tion in its orbi | t was about 3 | ° 5', and |
| the corres | ponding | elongation | 71 J° ; | and the comet h | ad acquired t | his elon |
| gation fro | m the su | n Jan. 4, | about si | x in Ae evenin | g. Again, in | the year |
| 1680, Nov. | 11, the | diurnal m | otion | of the comet th | at then appe | ared was |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| about 4|° | ; and th | e corresp | onding | elongation 79f | happened No | w. 10, a |
| little befor | e midni | ght. Now | at the | times named the | se comets had | arrived |
| at an equa | l distanc | e from th | e sun w | ith the earth, a | nd the earth | was then |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| almost in | its perih | elion. Bu | t the fi | rst table is fitt | ed to the eart | h's mean |
| distance f | rom the | sun assume | d of 10 | 00 parts ; and | this distance | is greater |
| by such an | excess o | f space as | the eart | h might describe | by its annual | motion |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| in one day | 's time, | or the come | t by it | s motion in 16 | hours. To r | educe the |
| comet to | this mean | distance | of 100 | 0 parts, we add | those 16 hou | rs to the |
| former tim | e, and | subduct th | em from | the latter ; an | d thus the fo | rmer be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comes Jan | . 4d. 10'1 | . afternoon | ; the l | atter Nov. 10, a | bout six in t | he morn |
| ing. But | from th | e tenor an | d progr | ess of the diurn | al motions i | t appears |
| that both | comets w | ere in con | junction | with the sun be | tween Dec. 7 | and Dec. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8 ; and f | rom then | ce to Jan. | 4d. 10h | . afternoon on | one side, and | to Nov. |
| 10'. 6h. of | the mo | rning on | the othe | r, there are ab | out 28 days. | And so |
| many days | (by Tab | le 1) the | motions | in parabolic tra | jectories do r | equire. |
| But th | ough we | have hithe | rto cons | idered those co | mets as two, | yet, from |
| the coinci | dence of | their peri | helions | and agreement o | f their veloci | ties, it is |
| probable | that in | effect they | were | but one and the | same ; and | if so, the |
| orbit of t | his come | t must ha | ve eithe | r been a parabo | la, or at leas | t a conic |
| section ve | ry little | differing | from a | parabola, and a | t its vertex a | lmost in |
| contact wi | th the su | rface of t | he sun. | For (by Tab. | 2) the distan | ce of the |
| comet fro | m the e | arth, Nov. | 10, was | about 360 par | ts, and Jan. | 4, about |
| 630. Fr | om which | distances | , togeth | er with its lon | gitudes and | latitudes, |
| we infer t | he distan | ce of the | places | in which the com | et was at th | ose times |
| to have be | en about | 280 : the | half of | which, viz., 140 | , is an ordina | te to the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| comet's or | bit, cutti | ng off a | portion | of its axis near | ly equal to t | he radius |
| of the or b | is magnu | s, that is | , t o 100 | 0 parts. And, | therefore, div | iding the |
| square of | the ordi | nate 140 b | y 1000, | the segment of | the axis, we | find the |
| latu$ rect | um 19, 1 | 6, or in a | round | number 20 ; t he | fourth part | whereof, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5, is the d | istance o | f the verte | x of the | orbit from the | sun's centre. | But the |
| time corre | sponding | to the di | stance o | f 5 parts in Tab. | 1 is 27d. 16h | . 7'. Ir. |

time  of  the comet's  ingress  into  the sphere  of  the orbis magnns,  to  Jan..
4'1. 10h. afternoon,  the time  of  its egress from  the same,  there  are  55(1. 16h.
The  small  difference  of  7£u. in  this rude  way  of computing  is to be neg
lected, and  perhaps  may  arise from  the  comet's  motion  being  some  small
matter  slower,  as it must  have  been  if the  true  orbit  in which  it was  car
ried  was  an  ellipsis.  The  middle  time  between  its ingress  and  egress  was
December   Sd.  21'. of the morning  ; and  therefore  at  this  time  the comet
ought  to have  been  in  its perihelion.  And  accordingly  that very  day, just
before  sunrising,  Dr. Halley  (as we  said) saw  the  tail short  and  broad,  but-
very  bright, rising  perpendicularly  from  the horizon.  From  the  position
of  the  tail  it is certain  that  the  comet  had  then  crossed  over  the  ecliptic,
and  got  into  north  latitude, and  therefore  had  passed  by  its perihelion,
which  lay on  the  other  side  of the  ecliptic, though  it had  not  yet come  into
conjunction  with  the  sun  ; and  the comet  [see more  of  this famous  comet,
p. 475  to 486] being  at this  time  between  its perihelion  and  its conjunc
tion  with  the  sun, must  have  been  in  its perihelion  a few  hours  before;
for in  so near  a distance  from  the sun  it must  have  been  carried  with  great
velocity, and  have  apparently  described  almost  half  a degree  every  hour.
  By  like computations  I find that  the comet  of 1618  entered  the sphere
of the  orbis maxims  December  7, towards  sun-setting ; but  its conjunc
tion with  the sun  was  Nov.  9, or 10, about  28  days intervening,  as  in the
preceding  comet  ; for from  the  size  of  the  tail  of  this, in wtrch  it was
equal  to the  preceding,  it is probable  that  this comet  likewise  did come
almost  into  a contact  with  the sun.  Four  comets  were  seen  that year  of
which  this was  the  last.  The  second, which  made  its  first appearance
October  31, in the neighbourhood  of the  rising  sun,  and  was  soon  after  hid
under  the  sun's  rays, 1 suspect  to have  been  the  same  with  the  fourth,
which  emerged  out  of  the  sun's  rays  about  Nov. 9.  To  these  we may  add
the comet  of  1607, which  entered  the  sphere  of  the  orbis mi^-tnis  Sept.
14, O.S.  and  arrived  at  its perihelion  distance  from  the sun  about  October
19, 35 days intervening.  Its perihelion  distance  subtended  an  apparent
angle  at the earth  of about  23  degrees, and  was  therefore  of 390  parts.
And  to  this number  of parts about  34  days correspond  in Tab.  1 .  Far
ther ; the comet  of 1665  entered  the  sphere  of  the  orbis  nta^tnts  about
March   17, and  came  to its perihelion  about  April  16, 30 days  intervening.
Its perihelion  distance  subtended  an  angle  at  the earth  of  about  seven
degrees, and  therefore  was  of 122  parts  : and corresponding  to  this number
of parts,  in Tab.  1, we  find 30 days.  Again  ; the comet  of  1 682  entered
the sphere  of  the orbis magnus  about  Aug.  11, and  arrived  at  its perihe
lion about  Sep.  16, being  then  distant  from  the sun by about  350  parts,  to
which,  in Tab.  I, belong 33^  days.  Lastly  ; that memorable  comet  of
Regiomontanus,  which  in  1472  was  carried  through  the  circum-polar
 parts  of our  northern  hemisphere  with  such  rapidity  as to  describe  40

| The small differe | nce of | 7£u. in thi | s rude w | ay of | computing | is to be neg |

| December Sd. 21'. | of th | e morning ; | and the | refore | at this tim | e the comet |
| ought to have bee | n in i | ts perihelio | n. And | accordi | ngly that v | ery day, just |
| before sunrising, | Dr. Ha | lley (as we | said) saw | the t | ail short an | d broad, but- |
| very bright, risin | g perp | endicularly | from th | e horiz | on. From | the position |
| of the tail it is c | ertain | that the c | omet had | then c | rossed over | the ecliptic, |
| and got into nor | th la | titude, and | therefore | had p | assed by it | s perihelion, |
| which lay on the | other | side of the e | cliptic, t | hough i | t had not y | et come into |
| conjunction with | the su | n ; and the | comet [s | ee more | of this fa | mous comet, |
| p. 4 75 to 486] be | ing at | this time | between | its per | ihelion and | its conjunc |
| tion with the sun | , must | have been | in its p | eriheli | on a few h | ours before; |
| for in so near a d | istance | from the s | un it must | have | been carrie | d with great |
| velocity, and have | appar | ently descri | bed almos | t half | a degree e | very hour. |
| By like comput | ations | I find that | the com | et of | 1618 entere | d the sphere |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| of the orbis max | ims | December 7 | , towards | sun-se | tting ; b ut | its conjunc |
| tion with the sun | was | Nov. 9, or 1 | 0, about | 28 days | intervenin | g, as in the |
| preceding comet | ; f or f | rom the si | ze of the | tail o | f this, in w | trch it was |
| equal to the pre | ceding, | it is proba | ble that | this c | omet likewi | se did come |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| which emerged ou | t of t | he sun's ray | s about N | ov. 9. | To these | we may add |
| the comet of 1607 | , whi | ch entered | the spher | e of t | he orbis mi | ^-tnis Sept. |

 degrees  in one  day, entered  the sphere  of the  orbis magnus  Jan  21, abonl
 the time  that  it was  passing by  the  pole, and, hastening  from  them*
 towards  the  sun, was  hid under  the  sun's  rays  about  the end  of  Feb.   ,
 whence  it is probable  that 30  days,  or a few  more,  were  spent between   its
 ingress  into the sphere  of the  orbis magnus  and  its perihelion.  Nor  did
 this comet  truly move  with  more  velocity  than  other  comets,  but owed  the
 greatness  of its apparent  velocity  to  its passing  by the  earth  at a  near distance.
    It appears,  then, that  the velocity  of comets  (p. 471),  so far as it can  be
 determined  by  these rude  ways  of computing,  is that  very  velocity  with
 which  parabolas,  or  ellipses near  to  parabolas,  ought  to be described;  and
 therefore  the distance  between  a comet  and  the sun  being given,  the velocity
 of the comet  is nearly given.  And  hence  arises  this problem.

       4    PROBLEM.
 The  relation  betwixt  the  velocity of a comet  and  its distance from  the
        sun's  centre being  given,  the comet's  trajectory  is required.
   If this problem  was  resolved, we  should  thence  have  a method  of  deter
mining  the  trajectories of comets  to the greatest  accuracy  : for if that  re
lation  be twice  assumed,  and from  thence  the trajectory  be twice computed,
and  the error  of each  trajectory  be found  from  observations,  the assumption
may  be corrected  by the Rule  of False, and  a third  trajectory may  thence
be found  that  will exactly  agree  with  the observations.  And  bv  deter

mining  the trajectories  of comets  after  this method,  we may  come"  at last,to a more  exact knowledge  of the parts through  which  those  bodies  travel,
of the velocities  with which  they  are  carried, what  sort  of trajectories  they
describe, and what  are the  true magnitudes  and  forms  of their  tails accord
ing to the various  distances  of  their  heads  from  the sun ; whether,  after
certain  intervals  of  time, the same  comets  do  return  again, and  in what
periods  they complete  their several  revolutions.  But  hhe problem  ma?  be
resolved  by determining,  first, the hourly  motion  of  a comet  to a ffiven time
from  three  or more  observations,  and  then  deriving  the trajectory  from  this
motion.  And  thus  the invention  of the  trajectory, depending  on  one  ob
servation,  and  its hourly motion  at the time  of this observation,  will  either
confirm  or disprove  itself; for the  conclusion  that  is drawn  from  the mo
tion only of an hour  or two  and  a false  hypothesis,  will never  agree  with
the motions  of  the comets  from  beginning  to end.  The  method  of  fh*
whole  computation  is this.

is likewise  given  both  in magnitude  and  position, together  with  the  dis
tance ST,  and  the angles STR,  PTR, STP.  Let  us assume  the  velocity
of the comet  in the  place P  to be  to the  velocity  of  a  planet  revolved
about  the sun  in  a  circle, at the same  distance  SP,  as V  to  1 ; and  we  shall
have  a line pP&  to be determined,  of this  condition,  that  the  space  /?w,
described  by the comet  in two  hours, may  be  to the space V  X  tr (that  is.
to the space  which  the  earth  describes  in the same  time  multiplied  by the
number  V) in the subduplicate  ratio  of ST,  the distance  of the  earth  from
the sun,  to SP,  the distance  of the comet  from  the  sun  ; and  that  the space
pP, described  by the comet  in the  first hour, may  be  to the space Pw,  de
scribed  by the comet  in the second  hour,  as the  velocity  in p  to the velocity
in P ; that  is, in the subduplicate  ratio  of the distance  SP  to the distance
S/7, or in the  ratio  of 2Sp  to SP  +  Sp ; for in this whole  work  I neglect
small  fractions  that  can  produce  no  sensible  error.
   In the  first place, then, as  mathematicians,  in the resolution  of  affected
equations,  are  wont,  for the  first essay, to assume  the  root  by conjecture,
so, in this analytical  operation,  I judge  of the  sought  distance TR  as I
best can by conjecture.  Then,  by Lem.   II. I draw  rp, first supposing   / R
equal  to Rp, and  again  (after the  ratio  of SP  to Sp  is discovered)  so  as
rR may  be  to Rp  as 2SP  to SP  +  Sp, and  I find  the  ratios  of  the  lines
pw,  rp, and  OR,  one  to the other.  Let M  be to V  X  tr as OR   to pi** ; and
because  the  square  of p<*> is to  the square  of V  X  tr as ST  to SP,  we
shall  have,  ex  aquo, OR2   to M2  as ST  to  SP, and  therefore  the  solid
OR2  X  SP  equal  to  the given  solid M2  X ST;  whence  (supposing  the
triangles STP,  PTR,  to be now  placed  in  the same  plane) TR,  TP,  SP,
PR,  will  be given, by Lem.  I.  All  this  I do, first by delineation  in  a rude
and  hasty way  ; then by  a new  delineation  with  greater  care  ; and,  lastly,
by an  arithmetical  computation.  Then  I proceed  to determine  the position
of the  lines  rp, pti, with  the greatest  accuracy,  together  with  the nodes  and
inclination  of the  plane  Spti  to  the plane  of  the  ecliptic  ; and  in that
plane  Spti  I describe  the  trajectory  in which  a body  let go from  the  place
P  in the direction  of the given  right  line  jf?c5 would  be carried  with  i velo
city that  is to the velocity  of the  earth  as pti to V  X  tr.  Q.E.F.

observation  with  the plane  Sjow, as  well  as the  comet's  place  in  its trajec
 tory  to the time  of  the observation.  If that  intersection  happens  in  this
 place,  it is a proof  that  the  trajectory  was  rightly determined  ; if other-

?     '  That  the greatest  tides happen  in the  syzygies  of the luminaries,  the  least  in their quadratures;
           and  that  at the third  hour  after  the appulse  of the moon   to the meridian  of the  place.    Bat
            that  out  of the syzygies  and  quadratures  those  greatest  and  least  tides deviate  a  little from
            that  third  hour  towards  the  third hour  after  the appulse  of  the  sun  to the  meridian,    .   536

      That  out  of the equator  the  tides  are  greater  and  less alternately, .  ....      537
       That,  by the conservation  of the impressed  motion,  the  difference  of the  tides  is diminished  ; and
             that  hence  it may  happen  that  the greatest  inensti  ual  tide  will  be the third  after  the syzygy,  5:38
       Thit  the motio   is of the  sea may  be retarded  by impediments  in  its channels, ....      538
       That  from  the impediments  of channels  and  shores  various phenomena  do  arite,  as that  the  sea
          may  flow but  once  every  day,                                                                     539

          '1 hat  the  tides  are  greater  in greater  and  deeper  seas;  greater  on  the  shores  of continents  than

      The  force  of the  sun  to disturb  the motions  of  the moon,  computed  from  the foregoing  principks,  542
      The  force  of the sun  to move  the  sea computed,                                                      543
      The  height  of  the  tide under  the equator  arising from  the  force  of  the  sun  computed,           .    .  543
      The  height  of the  tides under  the parallels  arising  from  the  sun's  force computed,   .        .  .    544

      The  force  of the moon   to excite  tides, and  the height  of the water  thence  arising, computed,  .   545
      That  those  forces  of  the sun  and  moon  are  scarcely  ?en?ible  by any  other  effect  beside  the  tides
           which  they  raise  in the  sea,                                                                       546

      That  the comets,  as  o ten  as  they become  visible  to  us, are  nearer  than  Jupiter, proved  from
              their parallax  in longitude,          .                                                                    548
      The  same  proved  from  their parallax  in latitude, .........         549
      The  same  proved  otherwise  by the  parallax,  ..........         550

      From  the  light  of the comets'  heads  it is proved  that  they  descend  to the  orbit  of  Saturn,   .    550
      And  also below  the  orb  of Jupiter,  and  sometimes  below  the  orb  of the  earth,        . .       .  551
      The  same  proved  from  the extraordinary  splendor  of their  tails when  they  are  near  the  sun, .   551

       The  same  confirmed  by  the great number  of comets  seen  in the region  of the  sun,      .        .  .   555
       This  also confirmed  by  the greater  magnitude  and  splendor  of the  tails after  the conjunction  of

      That  the  air and  vapour  in the  celestial  spaces  is of an immense  rarity  ; and  that  a small  quan
              tity of vapour  may  be  sufficient  to explain  all the phtcnomena   of the  tails  of comets, .   .  558
       After  what  manner  the  tails  of comets  may  arise from  the atmospheres  of their heads. .  .   559
